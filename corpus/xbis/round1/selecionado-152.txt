An Automated Approach for Cross-Browser Inconsistency (XBI) Detection
Due to the spread of the internet and the ever increasing number of web applications, the issue of compatibility across browsers has become very important. This compatibility issue is also referred as Cross Browser Inconsistency (XBI) wherein same website looks or behaves differently in different web browsers. In this paper our aim is to address this issue of compatibility and propose an automated approach of detecting XBIs. Cross Browser Inconsistencies can either be in the content, structure or behavior of the webpage. In order to get a grasp of the above mentioned types of inconsistencies, we surveyed some random websites and analyzed them in different browsers. We also studied the basic working of browser, in order to establish its connection with the occurrences of XBIs. Each browser has its own rendering mechanisms, which sometimes differs from standards. Hence, the execution of these websites is different in different browsers. Finally we have proposed an automated approach for XBI detection.
