Web Service Test Evolution
Abstract
In order to remain useful test scripts must evolve parallel to the test objects they are intended to test. In the approach described here the test objects are web services whose test script is derived from the web service interface definition. The test script structure is automatically generated from the WSDL structure with tags and attributes, however, the content, i.e. the test data has to be inserted by hand. From this script service requests are automatically generated and service responses automatically validated. As with other generated software artifacts, once the structure of the interface or the logic of the targeted service is changed, the content of the test script is no longer valid. It has to be altered and/or enhanced to fit the new interface structure and/or the altered service logic. In this paper the author proposes a semi-automated approach to solving this test maintenance problem and explains how it has been implemented in a web service testing tool by employing data reverse engineering techniques. The author also report on his experience with the approach when maintaining a test in the field.
