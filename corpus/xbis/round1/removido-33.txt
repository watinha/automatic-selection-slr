Evaluation of resizing capability of web browser
RESUMO
A new method and computer program for evaluating page resizing of a web browser. A web page with a test area having test elements is created. Then, the web page is displayed by the web browser and locations of at least two original edge points for each of the test elements are determined. After this, the test area within the web page is resized and displayed with the resized test area. Then, a further determination step is performed for each resized test element in the displayed web page, whereby locations of at least two respective resized edge points of the test element are determined. After obtaining these locations, comparisons between the locations of the at least two original edge points and the locations of the at least two respective resized edge points are made.
