Model Reverse-engineering of Mobile Applications with Exploration Strategies
Abstract This paper presents a model reverse-engineering approach  for mobile applications that belong to the Graphical User  Interface (GUI) application category. This approach covers the  interfaces of an application with automatic testing to incrementally  infer a formal model expressing the navigational paths and  states of the application. We propose the definition of a specialised  GUI application model which stores the discovered interfaces  and helps limit the application exploration. Then, we present an  algorithm based upon the Ant Colony Optimisation technique  which offers the possibility to parallelise the exploration and  to conceive any application exploration strategy. Finally, our  approach is experimented on Android applications and compared  to other tools available in the literature.
