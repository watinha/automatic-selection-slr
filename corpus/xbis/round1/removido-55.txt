An Oracle based on Image Comparison for Regression Testing of Web Applications
Abstract Much work has been done on automating regression
testing for Web applications, but most of them focus on test
data generation or test execution. Little work has been done
on automatically determining if a test passed or failed; testers
would need to visually confirm the result which can be a tedious
task. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that parts of a
Web page (such as advertisements) may change each time the
Web application is executed even though it has no bearing on the
Web application function itself. We thus propose a test oracle for
automatically determining the result of regression testing a Web
application. The key point of our approach is the identification
of parts that may change, which we call variable region. We
first generate the expected result, by executing the original (premodification)
Web application multiple times so that variable
regions can be identified. Then, after the Web application is
modified, regression testing is conducted by comparing the output
of the modified Web application against the expected output. An
evaluation confirmed the usefulness of our approach.
