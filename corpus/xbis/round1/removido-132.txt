Class coverage GUI testing for Android applications
Abstract:
Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets have become an integral part of a person's life. These portable devices opened up a new software market for mobile application development resulting in various applications from healthcare, banking till entertainment. Therefore, there is a need for mobile applications to be reliable and maintainable. In this paper we introduce an equivalent class based technique for testing the graphical user interface of Android applications. This technique is a specification based approach, in which test cases are generated based on the functionalities and the graphical user interface specification. For each possible user interface event a set of test cases are generated using equivalence class partitioning approach. Once the test cases are generated for the given application, the app is executed based on the generated test cases and results are compared with the other testing techniques. From the obtained results we can infer that our approach detects more bugs than other previous work. In addition, this approach helps in the generation of test cases at an early in the app development life cycle.
