A Comparative Study of Web Application Testing and Mobile Application Testing
Abstract:
Web application have gained increased acceptance over the years in companies and organization as the world move to a global village. Software developers have also grown interest in developing web applications compared to stand-alone application because of the immense benefits it offers such as ubiquity, platform dependence, low cost of support and maintenance, better speed and performance, piracy proof etc. As mobile application emerged in the last decade, attention has been focused on mobile applications by organizations and businesses in order to maximize their profits as much as possible. There has been a rapid increase of software release in the mobile applications store. As the growth of both web application and mobile application increase, the question of quality assurance remains a concern. A comparative study of software testing techniques can be performed to improve the standard of testing of both web and mobile application. This paper therefore reviews the similarity and difference in the testing mechanism.
