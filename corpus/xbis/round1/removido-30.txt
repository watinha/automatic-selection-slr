Technique for coordinating the distributed, parallel crawling of interactive client-server applications
RESUMO
An electronic device includes a memory and a processor coupled to the memory. The memory contains a master state graph. The master state graph includes information regarding the operation of interactive client-server application. The processor is configured to send a first job to a first worker node, send a second job to a second worker node, receive results of crawling the interactive client-server application, and integrate results of crawling the interactive client-server application into the master state graph. The first job includes crawling instructions for crawling a first portion of an interactive client-server application. The second job includes crawling instructions for crawling a second portion of the interactive client-server application. The first worker node and second worker node crawl the interactive client-server application in parallel.
