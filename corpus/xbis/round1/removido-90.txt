Search-based testing tools for Ajax- A systematic literature review
Search-based testing seeks to solve many novel problems including testing Ajax applications, and there have been a number of tools created to accomplish this purpose. Objective: This thesis aims to identify search-based software testing tools for Ajax web applications and how they have been evaluated. Method: Systematic literature review is used as the research methodology. Result: There are six different tools identified in scientific literature of which three are variants of Crawljax. Also, searchbased testing tools for Ajax are primarily evaluated through the use of case studies. Conclusion: The evaluation of the identified tools should be conducted using an experimental design in order to make them comparable and repeatable as well as follow benchmarking frameworks proposed in scientific literature.
