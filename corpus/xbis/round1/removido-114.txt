Reverse engineering of web applications
Even so many years after its genesis, the Internet is still growing. Not only are
the users increasing, so are the number of different programming languages or
frameworks for building Web applications. However, this plethora of technologies
makes Web applications source code hard to comprehend and understand,
thus deteriorating both their debugging and their maintenance costs.
In this context, a number of proposals have been put forward to solve
this problem. While, on one hand, there are techniques that analyze the entire
source code of Web applications, the diversity of available implementation
technology makes these techniques return unsatisfactory results. On the other
hand, there are also techniques that dynamically (but blindly) explore the applications
by running them and analyzing the results of randomly exploring
them. In this case the results are better, but there is always the chance that
some part of the application might be left unexplored.
This thesis investigates if an hybrid approach combining static analysis and
dynamic exploration of the user interface can provide better results. FREIA, a
framework developed in the context of this thesis, is capable of analyzing Web
applications automatically, deriving structural and behavioral interface models
from them.
