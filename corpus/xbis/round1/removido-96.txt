Supporting to Find Faults in Rich Internet Applications by Extracting Interaction-based State Machines
Asynchronous technologies such as Ajax make Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) responsive. When implementing and maintaining RIAs, developers have difficulties in figuring out complex behavior of the applications due to nondeterministic elements such as user events. Several researches have conducted to extract state machines based on execution results of Ajax applications for understanding support and testing. However, these execution results are within a limit of execution scenarios and environments prepared by developers. In this paper, we propose a tool that statically extracts state machines from Ajax-based RIAs by focusing on interactions with RIAs. We argue that the interactions can change the states of the application. Looking at both the extracted state machines and the source code, developers can verify the correctness of certain blind spots in the execution paths. From experimental results, we concluded that our tool could help participants understand the behavior and find faults.
