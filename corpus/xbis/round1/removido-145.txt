A Review on Web Application Testing and its Current Research Directions
Abstract  Testing is an important part of every software development process on which companies devote considerable time and effort. The burgeoning web applications and their proliferating economic significance in the society made the area of web application testing an area of acute importance. The web applications generally tend to take faster and quicker release cycles making their testing very challenging. The main issues in testing are cost efficiency and bug detection efficiency. Coverage-based testing is the process of ensuring exercise of specific program elements. Coverage measurement helps determine the thoroughness of testing achieved. An avalanche of tools, techniques, frameworks came into existence to ascertain the quality of web applications. A comparative study of some of the prominent tools, techniques and models for web application testing is presented. This work highlights the current research directions of some of the web application testing techniques.
