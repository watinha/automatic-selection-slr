Co-authorship Networks in Additive Manufacturing Studies Based on Social Network Analysis
In the last 30 years there has been growing interest in additive manufacturing technology. Coauthorship
of published papers plays such an important role in scientific development. The
collaborative research social network on the field of additive manufacturing is paid particular
attention in this paper. A framework based on open source software is proposed to automate the
data collection and social network analysis. The characteristics of the overall network structure is
analyzed and visualized. The development process of AM collaboration community mode is
discussed. So as to provide inspiration for collaborative research and further development of
additive manufacturing technology.
