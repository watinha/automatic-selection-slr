Mining Stack Overflow for questions asked by web developers : an empirical study
Modern web applications consist of a significant amount of client-side code,
written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this thesis, we present a study
of common challenges and misconceptions among web developers, by mining
related questions asked on Stack Overflow. We use unsupervised learning to
categorize the mined questions and define a ranking algorithm to rank all the
Stack Overflow questions based on their importance. We analyze the top 50
questions qualitatively. The results indicate that (1) the overall share of web
development related discussions is increasing among developers, (2) browser
related discussions are prevalent; however, this share is decreasing with time,
(3) form validation and other DOM related discussions have been discussed
consistently over time, (4) web related discussions are becoming more prevalent
in mobile development, and (5) developers face implementation issues
with new HTML5 features such as Canvas. We examine the implications
of the results on the development, research, and standardization communities.
Our results show that there is a consistent knowledge gap between the
options available and options known to developers. Given the presence of
knowledge gap among developers, we need better tools customized to assist
developers in building web applications.
