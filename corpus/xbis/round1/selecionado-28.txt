Determining differences in an event-driven application accessed in different client-tier environments
RESUMO  In one embodiment, a method includes dynamically crawling an event-driven application in a plurality of client-tier environments; for each of the client-tier environments, generating a behavioral model of the event-driven application based on the dynamic crawling; for each of the behavioral models, determining one or more pairwise equivalences with respect to one or more other ones of the behavioral models; and, for each of the client-tier environments, determining one or more differences in an end-user experience of the event-driven application in the client-tier environment with respect to one or more other end-user experiences of the event-driven application in one or more other ones of the client-tier environments.
