A Crowdsourcing framework for Detecting Cross-Browser Issues in Web Application
With the advent of Web 2.0 application, and the increasing number of browsers and platforms on which the applications can be executed, cross-browser incompatibilities (XBIs) are becoming a serious problem for organizations to develop web-based software with good user experience. Although some techniques and tools have been proposed to identify XBIs, some XBIs are still missed as only partial state space is explored (by the crawler) in the testing environment. To address this limitation, based on record/replay technique, this paper proposed a crowdsourcing framework to detect cross-browser issues for Web application deployed in the field. Our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed technique is effective and efficient, improves on the state of the art.
