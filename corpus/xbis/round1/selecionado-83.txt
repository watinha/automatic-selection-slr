Automatic test tool for webpage design with micro-browsers on mobile platforms
Architecture that provides a convenient and effective test tool for testing and ensuring that webpages using micro-browsers are sufficiently designed and operational. A task library is developed for manipulating browsers on a handheld device, and includes one or more seamless methods that operate the different browsers in the same way. Seamless virtual functions that manipulate different micro-browsers include, but are not limited to browser launch, exiting a browser, navigating to a home page, clearing a cache, navigating to a webpage, reloading a webpage, getting the current info for a webpage, navigating back to a webpage, checking a page title, and capturing a screen, for example. Device features can also be manipulated to ensure consistency across the testing process.
