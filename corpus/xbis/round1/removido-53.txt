A Mapping Study on Software Product Lines Testing Tools
Abstract The benefits of using a software testing tool in order  to achieve significant reductions in cost and time to market,  and, at the same time, increasing the quality has encouraged  the adoption of testing tools both in single systems and product  lines. In this context, this study focuses on the following goals:  analyze how the available tools are supporting the Software  Product Lines (SPL) Testing Process, investigate the state-of-theart  on single system and SPL testing tools, synthesize available  evidence, and identify gaps among the tools, available in the  literature. A mapping study was undertaken to analyze important  aspects that should be considered when adopting testing tools. A  set of four research questions were defined in which 33 studies,  dated from 1999 to 2011, were evaluated. From the total of 33  studies considered, 24 of them described single system testing  tools and the other 9 described SPL testing tools. However, there  is insufficient information about publications describing tools  used in the industry. There is no tool suitable to all testing levels  of a SPL, researchers need to consider the feasibility of adapting  existing tools or constructing new tools.
