A Grey-box Approach for Automated GUI-Model Generation of Mobile Applications
Abstract. As the mobile platform continues to pervade all aspects of  human activity, and mobile applications, or mobile apps for short, on  this platform tend to be faulty just like other types of software, there is  a growing need for automated testing techniques for mobile apps. Modelbased  testing is a popular and important testing approach that operates  on a model of an apps behavior. However, such a model is often not available  or of insufficient quality. To address this issue, we present a novel  grey-box approach for automatically extracting a model of a given mobile  app. In our approach, static analysis extracts the set of events supported  by the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the app. Then dynamic crawling  reverse-engineers a model of the app, by systematically exercising  these events on the running app. We also present a tool implementing  this approach for the Android platform. Our empirical evaluation of this  tool on several Android apps demonstrates that it can efficiently extract  compact yet reasonably comprehensive models of high quality for such  apps.
