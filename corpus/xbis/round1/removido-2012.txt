Traceability Types for Mastering Change in Collaborative Software Quality Management
Abstract  Software is constantly evolving and to successfully comprehend and manage this evolutionary change is a challenging task which requires traceability support. In this paper we propose a novel approach to traceability as a cornerstone for successful impact analysis and change management, in the context of collaborative software quality management. We first motivate the crucial role of traceability within lifecycle management of the new generation of distributed fragmented software services. Based on the model-based collaborative software quality management framework of Living Models, we then categorize software quality management services and identify novel types of traceability. This is followed by an overview and classification of sample software quality management services from literature, enabled by the interrelation with the identified types of traceability. From this classification we derive the need for further research on traceability in collaborative software quality management.
