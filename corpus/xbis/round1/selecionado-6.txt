WebMate: Generating Test Cases for Web 2.0
Abstract. Web applications are everywhere well tested web applications  however are in short supply. The mixture of JavaScript, HTML and  CSS in a variety of different browsers makes it virtually impossible to apply  static analysis techniques. In this setting, systematic testing becomes  a real challenge. We present a technique to automatically generate tests  for Web 2.0 applications. Our approach systematically explores and tests  all distinct functions of a web application. Our prototype implementation  WEBMATE handles interfaces as complex as Facebook and is able to  cover up to 7 times as much code as existing tools. The only requirements  to use WEBMATE are the address of the application and, if necessary,  user name and password
