Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing of Web Applications
Recently, technologies of web applications and web browser are becoming more complex, which causes different issues on different web browsers. Although there are many cross-browser detection tools on the market, all of them mainly focus on the front-end, and they are lack of detection on web page exploring and cross-browser issues detecting. The purpose of this research is to track the web applications structure and find their cross-browser issues.  This research first defines and classifies cross-browser issues, purposes the browser debugger XB-tester, collects data through cross-browser crawling technologies, and finally analyzes cross-browser issues and displays error reports.  Web developers can use this tool to effectively reduce the human cost to achieve cross-browser automation testing purposes.
