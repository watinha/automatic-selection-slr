An automatic layout faults detection technique in responsive web pages considering JavaScript defined dynamic layouts
Abstract:  Revolutionary changes in technology has brought a lots of different types of devices towards the Internet enabled services. It has become challenging to keep web sites functional and user friendly in a wide range of devices. Responsive Web Design (RWD) steps up to facilitate the necessary support to overcome those challenges with complex cascading style sheet (CSS) and JavaScript defined layouts. Fluidly modified layout that controls appearance of Responsive Web Pages (RWP) is subjected to erroneous when faulty CSS and JavaScript modifies the actual look of the web page. Though several methods have already been proposed to detect layout faults in web pages, they are error-prone and time consuming in nature. Thus an automatic approach considering both CSS and JavaScript defined dynamic layout fault detection technique have been proposed in this paper. Simulation result demonstrates that proposed technique outperforms the existing methods in case of time requirement, memory requirement and fault detection rate.
