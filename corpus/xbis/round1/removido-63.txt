Measuring and Improving Website User Experience using UX Methodologies: A Case Study on Cross Browser Compatibility Heuristic
Abstract The growing diversity of web-client platform
configurations causes websites to vary unpredictably, creating a
myriad of challenges during software development life cycle
(SDLC). This eventually affects websites user experience (UX).
Exploratory heuristic evaluation (EHE) and lab-based usability
testing (LBUT) are popular usability evaluation methods (UEM)
that could be used to measure and improve the websites UX.
Hence, the objective of this study is to derive and validate the
EHE and LBUT process flow for website cross browser
compatibility. In addition to finding compatibility defects using
EHE, it is important to determine the reliability of these defects
using LBUT. When it comes to improving websites UX, root
cause analysis (RCA) is performed and recommendation are
provided to the design and development team. From the results,
it can be concluded that the compatibility guideline and process
flow developed can improve the productivity and reliability of the
EHE and LBUT methodologies.
