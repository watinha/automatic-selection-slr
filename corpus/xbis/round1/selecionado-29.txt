X-Check: A Novel Cross-Browser Testing Service Based on Record/Replay
Abstract:  With the advent of Web 2.0 application, and the increasing number of browsers and platforms on which the applications can be executed, cross-browser incompatibilities (XBIs) are becoming a serious problem for organizations to develop web-based software. Although some techniques and tools have been proposed to identify XBIs, they cannot assure the same execution when the application runs across different browsers as only explicit user activity is considered, and thus prone to generating both false positives and false negatives. To address this limitation, this paper describes X-Check, a platform that enables cross-browser testing as a service by leveraging record/replay technique. Comparing to existing techniques and tools, X-Check supports to detect cross-browser issues with high accuracy. It also provides useful support to developers for diagnosis and (eventually) elimination of XBIs. Our empirical evaluation shows that X-Check is effective, improves the state of the art.
