Search-based security testing of web applications
SQL injections are still the most exploited web application vulnerabilities. We present a technique to automatically detect such vulnerabilities through targeted test generation. Our approach uses search-based testing to systematically evolve inputs to maximize their potential to expose vulnerabilities. Starting from an entry URL, our BIOFUZZ prototype systematically crawls a web application and generates inputs whose effects on the SQL interaction are assessed at the interface between Web server and database. By evolving those inputs whose resulting SQL interactions show best potential, BIOFUZZ exposes vulnerabilities on real-world Web applications within minutes. As a black-box approach, BIOFUZZ requires neither analysis nor instrumentation of server code; however, it even outperforms state-of-the-art white-box vulnerability scanners.
