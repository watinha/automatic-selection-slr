Analysis and Identification of Cross Browser Inconsistency Issues in Web Application using  Automation Testing
Abstract  Web      technologies   of   inconsistency      and      Web  standards  it    to    be    consistent    with    different  web  technology  evolution,    Web  application    developers    has    been  broadly  rang  of  face  on  the  different  certain  problem  .  Web    applications  become  difficult  part  for  them  to  keep  track  problem    of    their  web  correctly  rendered across  broad  range  of  browsers  and  platforms.      It   kind   of   cross-browser   inconsistency   (XBI),  developers      are  keep  checking    that  document  and  platform  produced  by  the  web  application  is  appropriate  pass  the  across  every useful browser-platform so  many combinations. It take the  requires  more  than  execution  time  and      error  results  in  web  application.   This   web      cross-browser      inconsistency   existing  testing    tools    for  speed    up  the    process  of    automating  and  the  rendering  of  a  document  in    cross    browsers    and  different  platforms,    and    using    either  image  analysis,  and    Document  Object    Model    (DOM)    analysis    to  the  feature  of  cross-browser  inconsistency. This dissertation are comparisons of  the  problem  of  cross-browser    inconsistency    testing    with  the  modern    web  applications  and their  functionality check  the accuracy  of web  applications  behavior    with    different  different    web  browsers  and    their  present    a    solution.  In  the  reasons  of  cross-browser  inconsistency issues and their so many solutions to them are been  presented     feature     different     cross-browser     inconsistency.  Proposed  solution  has  been  used  the  concept  of  Automation  Testing  using  Behavioral  methodol  ogy  of  the  web  application  on  different browsers such as Firefox, Internet Explorer and  Google  Chrome.  For  the  test  bed  selenium  and  TestNG  variation  has  been  integrated  onto  the  eclipse  java  environment.  Obtained  results  has  proven  that  the  pr  oposed  XBI  validation  method  outperform  and  provides  the  cost  effective  solution  instead  of  paying  high  cost  to  other  testing  service  provider  lie  Browser-  stack
