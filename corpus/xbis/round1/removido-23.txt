Chapter Five - Advances in Testing JavaScript-Based Web Applications
Abstract
JavaScript is a flexible and expressive prototype-based scripting language that is used by developers to create interactive web applications. The language is interpreted, dynamic, weakly typed, and has first-class functions. It also interacts extensively with other web languages such as CSS and HTML at runtime. All these characteristics make JavaScript code particularly error-prone and challenging to analyze and test. In this chapter, we explore recent advances made in analysis and testing techniques geared toward JavaScript-based web applications. In particular, we look at recent empirical studies, testing techniques, test oracle automation approaches, test adequacy assessment methods, fault localization and repair, and Integrated Development Environment support to help programmers write better JavaScript code.
