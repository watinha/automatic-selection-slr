Online shopping cart
This thesis is about online shopping cart systems. After researching the various shopping cart systems, a user friendly shopping cart system has been developed and a mail delivery system has been incorporated into this shopping cart system. A mail delivery system is a system where the user can enter the email ID of a friend and suggest a product. Moreover, users can have a record of the items bought.
