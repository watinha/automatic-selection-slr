Searching for Behavioural Bugs with Stateful Test Oracles in Web Crawlers
Abstract:
Web applications pervade all aspects of human activity today. Therefore the content of the web has become extremely important. According to the great number of applications present nowadays, as a consequence, the manifestation of a bug has become very common. Testing modern web applications, so called "Web 2.0" applications has become more difficult due to their "stateful" nature, so the development of an approach capable of testing these applications in order to detect these bugs has become a necessity. The paper presents an automated approach for testing these dynamic web applications, where a combination of dynamic crawling and back-end testing is used to automatically detect behavioural bugs.
