Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing Based on Model Comparison
Abstract:
As Web applications are more widely used and the browser and operating system becomes more diversiform, cross-browser incompatibility becomes more and more serious which may lead to visual faults or malfunction. The existing tools are difficult to pinpoint incompatibility. We propose a model comparison-based compatibility testing method. CRAWLJAX, an open source crawler tool, is used to build the behavioral model of the Web application under testing. Two models are generated by crawling the application in the reference browser and the target browser respectively, and then they are compared to find and locate incompatibility issues. It reduces the workload of the test and repair. Finally, we use a simple example to illustrate our approach.
