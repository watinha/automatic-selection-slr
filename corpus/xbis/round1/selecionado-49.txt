IE browser compatibility for web applications
Web browsing has evolved from the viewing of static, content-oriented web pages to the execution of dynamic applications over the web. This has initiated the problem of cross browser incompatibility from simple look and feel issues to critical functional failures. Internet Explorer (IE) is the most unpopular browser among the developers due to its lack of web standards compliance and peculiar features. However, it is the most leading choice in the market according to recent browser usage statistics. As a result, developers discover that the support of IE in the web applications is needed for satisfying the customers. However, providing such support is difficult as IE has certain restrictions in its features. This paper introduces cross browser compatibility, uncovers few of the idiosyncrasies of IE and provides solutions which can be useful in developing web applications with IE browser support.
