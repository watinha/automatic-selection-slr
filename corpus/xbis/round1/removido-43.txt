Engenharia reversa de padroes de interacao
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are populated with recurring behaviors that vary only slightly. For example, authentication (login / password) is a behavior common to many software applications. However, there are different behaviors between different implementations of this behavior. Sometimes a message appears when the user does not enter the correct data, sometimes, the application software only erases entered data and shows no indication to the user. These recurring behaviors (UI patterns) are well identified in the literature.The goal of this dissertation is to continue the work already done on an existing tool called PARADIGM-RE, a dynamic reverse engineering approach to extract User Interface (UI) Patterns from existent Web applications. As such, we will develop a data analysis module with the goal of improving and substantiate the existing identifying heuristics set, and we will extend the current set of identifiable patterns.
