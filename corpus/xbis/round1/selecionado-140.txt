Automatic detection of cross-browser incompatibilities using machine learning and screenshot similarity: student research abstract
Cross Browser Incompatibilities (XBIs) stands for compatibility issues which can be observed while rendering the same Web application in different browsers. The increasing number of browser implementations and the continuous evolving characteristic of Web technologies, lead to differences in how browsers behave and render Web applications. Every element of a Web application should be correctly rendered and present the same behavior, despite the Web browser implementation, version, or OS which is used by users [1]. In order to overcome this issue during the Web Engineering process, developers must detect and fix XBIs before deploying Web applications, regardless of the effort and cost required to conduct these inspections. This research has the goal of elaborating an approach for automatically detecting XBIs in Web applications, using machine learning (supervised learning algorithms) and screenshot similarity to detect XBIs. Next section presents the related work of this research.
