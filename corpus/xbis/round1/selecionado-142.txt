TESTAR: Tool Support for Test Automation at the User Interface Level
Abstract
Testing applications with a graphical user interface (GUI) is an important, though challenging and time consuming task. The state of the art in the industry are still capture and replay tools, which may simplify the recording and execution of input sequences, but do not support the tester in finding fault-sensitive test cases and leads to a huge overhead on maintenance of the test cases when the GUI changes. In earlier works the authors presented the TESTAR tool, an automated approach to testing applications at the GUI level whose objective is to solve part of the maintenance problem by automatically generating test cases based on a structure that is automatically derived from the GUI. In this paper they report on their experiences obtained when transferring TESTAR in three different industrial contexts with decreasing involvement of the TESTAR developers and increasing participation of the companies when deploying and using TESTAR during testing. The studies were successful in that they reached practice impact, research impact and give insight into ways to do innovation transfer and defines a possible strategy for taking automated testing tools into the market.
