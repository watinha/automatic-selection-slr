A Demonstration Case on Steps and Rules for the Transition from Process-Level to Software Logical Architectures in Enterprise Models
Abstract  At the analysis phase of an enterprise information system development, the alignment between the process level requirements (information systems) with the product level requirements (software system) may not be properly achieved. Modeling the processes for the enterpriseï¿½s business is often insufficient for implementation teams, and implementation requirements are often misaligned with business and stakeholder needs. In this paper, we demonstrate, though a real industrial case, how transition steps and rules are used to assure that process- and product-level requirements are aligned, within an approach that supports the creation of the intended requirements. The input for the transition steps is an information system logical architecture, and the output is a product-level (software) use case model.
