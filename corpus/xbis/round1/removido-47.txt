Technique for stateless distributed parallel crawling of interactive client-server applications
A distributed computing system includes worker nodes and a master node including a processor coupled to a memory. Each worker node crawls a portion of an interactive client-server application. The memory includes a master state graph, including the results of crawling. The master node is configured to examine the master state graph to determine a number of reconverging traces, receive a result from a job from a worker node if the number of reconverging traces is below a threshold, and add the result to the master state graph without attempting to remove duplicate states or transitions. A trace includes states and transitions representing valid. A reconvergent trace includes a trace including a reconvergent state, which is a state that can be reached through two or more distinct traces. The result containing states and transitions is associated with crawling a first portion of the interactive client-server application.
