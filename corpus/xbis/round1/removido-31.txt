Webbasierte Re-Implementierung von LICARA nanoSCAN
Abstract
Thanks to the expensive research the number of nanoparticles and nanomaterials
and their variations have signifantly increased during the last years.
Even though great expectations are placed on nanoparticles there are still a
lot of unanswered questions regarding the bene
ts and risks towards human
and environment.
In September 2014, EMPA developed in cooperation with the companies
TNO and NCB the LICARA guidelines to be used to conduct a Life Cycle,
Risk and Bene
t Assessment of nanoparticles. The LICARA nanoSCAN Excel
version is connected to these guidelines and is acting as a semi-quantitative
decision support tool while answering questions.
Within the scope of this bachelor thesis a web based version of the Excel
tool has been developed to increase the usability of the software. The existing
Excel tool has been analysed using the Design principles of Donald Norman.
Based on these results the requirements were made. The developed tool has
been tested by users and developers of the Excel tool and their feedback has
been considered during the re-design.
