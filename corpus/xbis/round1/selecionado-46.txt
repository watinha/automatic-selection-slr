Automatic Deformations Detection in Internet Interfaces: ADDII
Abstract  Developers have been trying to create uniform and consistent webpages in the different browsers available in the market. Known as Crossbrowser issue, it affects pages in different ways, on its functionalities and visually aspects and sometimes not related to the source code. Using screenshot and image comparison algorithms, this paper presents a technique for automated detection of visual deformations in web pages using a tool developed during the research called Automatic Deformations Detection in Internet Interfaces (ADDII).
