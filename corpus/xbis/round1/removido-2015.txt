A Comparative Study of Software Testing Techniques
Abstract
Nowadays, software systems have become an essential element in our daily life. To ensure the quality and operation of software, testing activities have become primordial in the software development life cycle (SDLC). Indeed, software bugs can potentially cause dramatic consequences if the product is released to the end user without testing. The software testing role is to verify that the actual result and the expected result are consistent and ensure that the system is delivered without bugs. Many techniques, approaches and tools have been proposed to help check that the system is defect free. In this paper, we highlight two software testing techniques considered among the most used techniques to perform software tests, and then we perform a comparative study of these techniques, the approaches that supports studied techniques, and the tools used for each technique. We have selected the first technique based on the 2014 survey [62] that heighted the motivations for using the Model-based-testing, and by analyzing the survey results we have found that some MBT limits are benefits in Risk based testing, the second technique in our study.
