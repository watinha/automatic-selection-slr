Chapter Four - Advances in Web Application Testing, 2010 2014
As web applications increase in popularity, complexity, and size, approaches and tools to automate testing the correctness of web applications must continually evolve. In this chapter, we provide a broad background on web applications and the challenges in testing these distributed, dynamic applications made up of heterogeneous components. We then focus on the recent advances in web application testing that were published between 2010 and 2014, including work on test-case generation, oracles, testing evaluation, and regression testing. Through this targeted survey, we identify trends in web application testing and open problems that still need to be addressed.
