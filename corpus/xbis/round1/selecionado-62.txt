Detection of Cross Browser Inconsistency by Comparing Extracted Attributes
Abstract The advancement in web technology and popularity of web applications amplifies the inconsistencies
between various web browsers. These inconsistencies augment cross browser incompatibilities that constitute different
look on different browsers for a particular web application. In some cases, Cross-Browser Inconsistencies (XBIs)
consists of acceptable difference whereas these may entirely prevent users from accessing part of a web applications
functionality in other cases. Therefore, testing process of a web application must be performed comprehensively on
multiple browsers to achieve consistency. Available tools and techniques require a considerable manual effort to
recognize such issues and provide limited support for fixing the cause of the issues. In this paper, we propose a
technique for detecting cross-browser issues without human intervention.
