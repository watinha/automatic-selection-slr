Browser Compatibility: the State of the Art from a Historical Perspective
ABSTRACT  Browser compatibility is an aspect of web development  that reaches back to the beginning of the internet. Because  browsers have been marketed by various vendors  in a competitive landscape, fragmentation was inevitable.  This creates technical challenges for web developers whom  have incentive to create websites that perform predictably  on different browsers, browser versions and rendering engines.  Over the years the browser landscape has changed  and so has mutual compatibility. Until now, no research  has been conducted that provides insight in the developments  of this area. Little is therefore known about the  state of the art relative to the historical context. This paper  provides this missing information by using available  data sources. The outcomes show that developers should  be less concerned with supporting legacy browsers and versions  and can be more confident about feature support because  of an increase in use of more compatible browsers.  However, it was also found that feature support among  browsers is decreasing.
