Visualization of automated test results obtained by the TESTAR tool
Abstract. Bigger and more complex software systems demand quality
practices that are seldom carried out in real industry. A common
practice is to provide a post-release maintenance service of products to
correct defects reported by the end user. In previous work we presented
TESTAR, a technology-agnostic tool for automated testing of applications
from their GUI. Here we introduce state-transition graph models
derived from TESTAR test results as a tool for visualisation of what has
been tested, to which extent and which software defects were found. We
discuss how such models enable to perform quality assessment of software
products by inspecting and debugging the system behaviour from
the GUI perspective. This constitutes a step forward in aid of software
developers and testers, since the User Interface is commonly the means
end-users encounter potential software defects.
