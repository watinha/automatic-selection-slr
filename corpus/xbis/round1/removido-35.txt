Architecture for distributed, parallel crawling of interactive client-server applications
RESUMO  In one embodiment, a distributed computing system includes a first worker node configured to execute a first job, a second worker node configured to execute a second job, and a master node including a processor coupled to a memory. The first job indicates a first portion of an interactive client-server application to be crawled. The second job indicates a second portion of an interactive client-server application to be crawled. The second worker node and the first worker node are configured to execute their respective jobs in parallel. The second job indicates a second portion of an interactive client-server application to be crawled. The master node is configured to assign the first job to the first worker node, assign the second job to the second worker node, and integrate the results from the first worker node and the second worker node into a record of operation of the application.
