Detect Cross-Browser Issues for JavaScript-Based Web Applications Based on Record/Replay
Abstract:  With the advent of Web 2.0 application, and the increasing number of browsers and platforms on which the applications can be executed, cross-browser incompatibilities (XBIs) are becoming a serious problem for organizations to develop web-based software. Although some techniques and tools have been proposed to identify XBIs, a number of false positives and false negatives still exist as they cannot assure the same execution when the application runs across different browsers. To address this limitation, leveraging existing record/replay technique, we developed X-Check, a novel cross-browser testing technique and tool, which supports automated XBIs detection with high accuracy. Our empirical evaluation shows that X-Check is effective and improves the state of the art.
