Evolution of Web Systems
The World Wide Web has led to a new kind of software, web systems, which are based on web technologies. Just like software in other domains, web systems have evolution challenges. This chapter discusses evolution of web systems on three dimensions: architecture, (conceptual) design, and technology. For each of these dimensions we introduce the state-of-the-art in the techniques and tools that are currently available. In order to place current evolution techniques into context, we also provide a survey of the different kinds of web systems as they have emerged, tracing the most important achievements of web systems evolution research from static web sites over dynamic web applications and web services to Ajax-based Rich Internet Applications.
