AdMotional: Towards Personalized Online Ads
ABSTRACT
AdMotional is a research project aiming at achieving a win-win
situation for online advertisers and web users alike by optimizing
the campaign selection process and creating personalized ads.
This results in increased campaign performance for advertisers,
and in more relevant and thus less annoying ads for consumers.
We give a general overview and present the system architecture,
before describing the main components in greater detail. We also
introduce the learning and optimization component and strategies,
before concluding with a summary and brief outlook into future
developments.
