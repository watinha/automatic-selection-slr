Model Inference and Automatic Testing of Mobile Applications
Abstract We consider, in this paper, the problem of automatically
testing Mobile applications while inferring formal
models expressing their functional behaviours. We propose a
framework called MCrawlT, which performs automatic testing
through application interfaces and collects interface changes to
incrementally infer models expressing the navigational paths
and states of the applications under test. These models could
be later used for comprehension aid or to carry out some
tasks automatically, e.g., the test case generation. The main
contributions of this paper can be summarised as follows: we
introduce a flexible Mobile application model that allows the
definition of state abstraction with regard to the application
content. This definition also helps define state equivalence
classes that segment the state space domain. Our approach
supports different exploration strategies by applying the Ant
Colony Optimisation technique. This feature offers the advantage
to change the exploration strategy by another one
as desired. The performances of MCrawlT in terms of code
coverage, execution time, and bug detection are evaluated on 30
Android applications and compared to other tools found in the
literature. The results show that MCrawlT achieves significantly
better code coverage in a given time budget.
