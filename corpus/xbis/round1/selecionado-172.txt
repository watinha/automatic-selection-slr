Improved Developer Support for the Detection of Cross-Browser Incompatibilities
Abstract    Various tools are available to help developers detect cross-browser incompatibilities (XBIs) by testing the documents generated by their code. We propose an approach that enables XBIs to be detected earlier in the development cycle by providing support in the IDE as the code is being written. This has the additional advantage of making it clear to the developers where the sources of the problems are and how to fix them. We present wIDE which is an extension to an IDE designed specifically to support web developers. wIDE uses a compatibility knowledge base to scan the source code for XBIs. The knowledge base is extracted automatically from online resources and periodically updated to ensure that the compatibility information is always up-to-date. In addition, developers can query documentation from within the IDE to access descriptions and usage examples of code statements. We report on a qualitative user study where developers provided positive feedback about the approach, but raised some issues to address in future work.
