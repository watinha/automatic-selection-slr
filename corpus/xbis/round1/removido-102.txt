A Testing Tool for Web Applications Using a Domain-Specific Modelling Language and the NuSMV Model Checker
Abstract:
Test case generation from formal models using model checking software is an established method. This paper presents a model-based testing approach for web applications based on a domain-specific language model. It is shown how the domain-specific language is transformed into the input language of the NuSMV model checker and how the resulting traces are converted into executable test scripts for various test automation tools. The presented approach has been implemented with comprehensive automation in a research tool which architecture is outlined.
