RUP Alignment and Coverage Analysis of CMMI ML2 Process Areas for the Context of Software Projects Execution
Abstract
The simultaneous adoption of CMMI and RUP allows the definition of �what to do� (with the support of CMMI) and �how to do� (with the support of RUP) in the context of executing software development projects. In this paper, our main contribution relates to the alignment of CMMI ML2 with RUP, in the context of executing software projects and the analysis of RUP coverage. We present the alignment for CMMI ML2 process areas, incorporating priority mechanisms. The adopted case study allows the analysis of the way RUP supports CMMI ML2 process areas taking into account the proposed alignment and the theoretical coverage analyzed. For particular process areas, RUP can be considered a good approach for CMMI ML2 implementation.
