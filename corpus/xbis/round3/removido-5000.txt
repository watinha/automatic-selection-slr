Efficient means to test server generated applications on mobile device
Systems and methods are provided to test changes for a mobile app built by web-based tooling directly on a physical mobile device. A first application can be loaded on a mobile device. The first application can receive metadata of a second application. The first application can execute the second application using the metadata. Access to local resources can be intercepted and redirected to the server for processing. Additionally, changes made to the second application using the web-based tooling can be pushed to the first application using a persistent channel allowing the changes to be immediately tested.
