Software testing system and method
A computer implemented system and method for testing code for implementation in web browsers, implements test class code defining test cases for testing operations on web applications implementable by different web browser types, and implements handler class code comprising code specific to each web browser and defining strategies to be used by test cases. The handler class code implements a handler interface and the test class code uses the handler interface to identify the methods to be used for test cases. A non-transient storage medium stores code for a handler template supporting different web browser types for use in a test environment, the code comprising code to identify browser specific strategies for implementation in the test environment; code to implement a strategy support interface for use by a handler factory to select a handler instance; and code to implement a handler interface for use by a test case to identify methods for testing web browser functions.
