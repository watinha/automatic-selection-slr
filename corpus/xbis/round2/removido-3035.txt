Automated Testing of Web Applications with TESTAR
Abstract
The TESTAR tool was originally conceived to perform automated testing of desktop applications via their Graphical User Interface (GUI). Starting from the premise that source code is not available, TESTAR automatically selects actions based only on information derived from the GUI and in this way generates test sequences on the fly. In this work we extend its use to web applications and carry out experiments using the Odoo open source management software as the testing object. We also introduce novel metrics to evaluate the performance of the testing with TESTAR, which are valid even when access to the source code is not available and testing is only possible via the GUI. We compare results obtained for two types of action selection mechanisms, based on random choice and   QQ -learning with different parameter settings. Statistical analysis shows the superiority of the latter provided an adequate choice of parameters; furthermore, the results point to interesting areas for improvement.
