Detecting influence caused by changing the source code of an application from which a document object model tree and cascading style sheet may be extracted
One embodiment is a computer-implemented method for detecting an influence caused by changing a source code of an application from which a document object model (DOM) tree and cascading style sheets (CSSs) are extracted. The method includes saving one or more input operations of a user of the application, a DOM tree, and a CSS for each of one or more times that an instruction is received to check a screen state. After the source code is changed, the one or more input operations are emulated in an operation order, for each of the one or more times. A DOM tree and CSS are acquired for each of the one or more times. The saved DOM tree and CSS are compared with the acquired DOM tree and CSS for each of the one or more times. A result of the comparison is output.
