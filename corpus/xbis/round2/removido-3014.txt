Issues on Developing a Location Aware Game for Mobile Browsers
Despite of recent development of mobile browsers and web technologies most location based games intended to be played with a phone are delivered as installable programs. This is unfortunate as in many cases applications which can be used directly from a web page without installation are much more accessible to users. In this paper we present common problematics building location based applications using only web technologies. The problematics are explored via building an example application and presented together with solution options.
