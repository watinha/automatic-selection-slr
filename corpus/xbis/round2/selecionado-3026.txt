Online application testing across browser environments
A stub can be loaded into a first browser environment of a browser application on a client machine, with the stub being loaded from a domain. The stub can execute to load an online application test into the first browser environment. Additionally, the test can execute in the first browser environment to conduct the test on an online application. For example, the test may be conducted from a second browser environment of the browser on the client machine. Performing the test can include loading one or more digital pages from the application into the second browser environment.
