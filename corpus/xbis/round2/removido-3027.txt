Real time web development testing and reporting system
Elements of the geometry of the image of a webpage as rendered on at least one target browser are compared with elements of a baseline geometry of the webpage to determine the differences between elements of the baseline geometry of the webpage and elements of the respective geometries of the image of the webpage as rendered on the at least one target browser. The elements of the image may be determined by a software tool for determining elements of a document geometry, such as a DOM geometry service. Code such as JavaScript may be injected into the webpage for use in determining the elements of the geometry of the image of the webpage. A list of issues that web developers face may be generated and the above differences between respective elements may allow arriving at a solution for at least some of the issues in order to provide testing of webpage information in real time.
