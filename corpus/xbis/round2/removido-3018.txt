Method and system for webpage regression testing
A regression testing system comprises an automatic test tool configured to capture a first web screen shot and a second web screen shot of a webpage, where the webpage has undergone an update or edit. The regression testing system also comprises a visual comparator configured to identify similar areas in the first web screen shot and the second web screen shot. The visual comparator receives, and compares characteristics of, the web screen shots. Furthermore, the regression testing system generates a report with marked different characteristics between the first and second web screen shots. The regression testing system identifies similar areas in the first and second web screen shots shot even if the similar areas are at different locations within the web screen shots. The comparison performed by the visual comparator includes performing a pixel comparison combined with a marking algorithm to group differences in smaller, related but separate areas.
