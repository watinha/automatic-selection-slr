AppCheck: A Crowdsourced Testing Service for Android Applications
Abstract:
It is well known that the fragmentation of Android ecosystem has caused severe compatibility issues. Therefore, for Android apps, cross-platform testing (the apps must be tested on a multitude of devices and operating system versions) is particularly important to assure their quality. Although lots of cross-platform testing techniques have been proposed, there are still some limitations: 1) it is time-consuming and error-prone to encode platform-agnostic tests manually, 2) test scripts generated by existing record/replay techniques are brittle and will break when replayed on different platforms, 3) Developers, and even test vendors have not equipped some special Android devices. As a result, apps have not been tested sufficiently, leading to many compatibility issues after releasing. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AppCheck, a crowdsourced testing service for Android apps. To generate tests that will explore different behavior of the app automatically, AppCheck crowdsources event trace collection over the Internet, and various touch events will be captured when real users interact with the app. The collected event traces are then transformed into platform-agnostic test scripts, and directly replayed on the devices of real users. During the replay, various data (e.g., screenshots and layout information) will be extracted to identify compatibility issues. Our empirical evaluation shows that AppCheck is effective and improves the state of the art
