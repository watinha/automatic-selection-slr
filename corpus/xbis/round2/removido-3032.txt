Closing Gaps between Capture and Replay: Model-based GUI Testing
Abstract. Testing software as a black box can be time consuming and errorprone.
Operating and monitoring the graphical user interface is a generic method
to test such systems. This work deals with convenient and systematic testing of
GUI software systems. It presents a new approach to model-based GUI testing
by combining the strengths of four well-researched areas combined: (1) the intuitive
capture&replay method, (2) widget trees for modeling the GUI, (3) state
charts and (4) the classification tree method. The approach is implemented as
a prototype and is currently under validation on a real GUI. The presented approach
includes the whole test cycle, from scanning the GUI and model-based
test specification to the automatic execution of tests.
