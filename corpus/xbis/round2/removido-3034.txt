Development and maintenance efforts testing graphical user interfaces: a comparison
For testing of graphical user interfaces many tools exists. The aim of this work is a statement regarding the advantages and disadvantages of various testing tools with regard to their use in the economic context to be taken. It is compared, inter alia, whether there are differences in the generations of test tools in terms of finding defects and which tool has the lowest development and maintenance costs. Results show that with QF-Test test suites can be created the quickest while EggPlant has the shortest maintenance time. TestComplete performs worse in both disciplines. For test robustness, no clear picture can be drawn. The selection of a test tool is typically done once in a project at the beginning and should be considered carefully.
