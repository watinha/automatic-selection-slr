Automated Localisation Testing in Industry with Test
Abstract
Test  ??  is a testing tool that automatically and dynamically generates, executes and verifies test sequences based on a tree model that is derived from the software User Interface through assistive technologies. Test  ??  is an academic prototype that we continuously try to transfer to companies to get feedback about its applicability. In this paper we report on one of these short experiences of using Test  ??  in industry at the Valencian company Indenova. We applied the tool to check the localisation quality of a secure web platform that encapsulates a set of applications as services.
