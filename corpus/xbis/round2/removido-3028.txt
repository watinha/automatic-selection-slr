Testing framework for dynamic web pages
A system and method for bucket testing includes: retrieving a user's information from a user in a bucket testing group when a request to serve a web page is received; determining from the user's information if the user has an active bucket identifier associated with the user's account in a persistent store; retrieving bucket parameters from the user's information when it is determined that the user has an active bucket identifier; determining if the bucket parameters are within a range assigned to the bucket testing group; passing the bucket parameters to the server; and loading configuration and files associated with the active bucket identifier.
