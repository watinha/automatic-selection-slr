Level dependencies of individual entities in random unit testing of structured code
Abstract:
Unit testing is the core fundamental to ensure code is in accordance with the design specifications. The coding and unit testing standard reflects the stability of project (not to mention the testing effort). Code stability is greatly influenced by the efforts of unit testing, which can be automated to reduce the human efforts. Inspite of several tools identified for unit testing, tools need to be able to identify the level dependencies or depth of program entity usage in software fragments. This factor greatly influences unit testing complexity. Higher the level of dependency, the greater the complexity of unit testing the code. This paper focuses on this factor which has been a trivial concern for developer over the years. This problem is neither limited nor restricted to a particular paradigm of programming language. Unit Testing becomes more effective when construct becomes more specific to be tested instead of checking the entire code being developed.
