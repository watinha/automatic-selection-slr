A Preliminary Survey of Factors Affecting Software Testers
Abstract:  Most software testing research has focused on the development of systematic, standardised, and automated testing methodologies and tools. The abilities and expertise needed to apply such techniques and tools - such as personality traits, education, and experience - have attracted a comparatively small amount of research attention. However, the limited research in the area to date provides some indication that the human traits of software testers are important for effective testing. This paper presents the opinions of software testers themselves, collected through an online survey, on the importance of a variety of factors that influence effective testing, including testing-specific training, experience, skills, and human qualities like dedication and general intelligence. The survey responses strongly suggest that while testing tools and training are important, human factors were similarly considered highly important. Domain knowledge, experience, intelligence, and dedication, amongst other traits, were considered crucial for a software tester to be effective. As such, while systematic methodologies are important, the individual most clearly does matter in software testing. The results of our research have implications for education, recruitment, training and management of software testers.
