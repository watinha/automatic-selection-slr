Unificando conceitos de avaliacao de desempenho, engenharia de desempenho e teste de software para a analise de sistemas computacionais
This master project presents a view of how Computers Science areas related to performance (Performance Evaluation, Software Performance Engineering and Software Performance Testing) can be related and also proposes a performance analysis methodology that contains concepts from all areas previously identified, so that it is more complete and can be understood by professionals of these three areas. To formalize this relationship, an ontology that shows how the correlation occurs between areas was built. And from the proposed methodology, it was possible to analyze the performance of ValiPar tool, in its parallel version, and it was concluded that the main bottleneck with respect to its scalability is its portion executed sequentially. Finally, it was observed that the proposed methodology has advantages compared to others, as a formalization in its analysis steps.
