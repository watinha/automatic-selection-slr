Canopus: A Domain-Specific Language for Modeling Performance Testing
Abstract:
Despite all the efforts to reduce the cost of the testing phase in software development, it is still one of the most expensive phases. In order to continue to minimize those costs, in this paper, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), built on top of MetaEdit+ language workbench, to model performance testing for web applications. Our DSL, called Canopus, was developed in the context of a collaboration1 between our university and a Technology Development Laboratory (TDL) from an Information Technology (IT) company. We present, in this paper, the Canopus metamodels, its domain analysis, a process that integrates Canopus to Model-Based Performance Testing, and applied it to an industrial case study.
