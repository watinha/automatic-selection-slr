A Label Taxonomy to Support Collaborative Formalization of Computer-interpretable Guidelines and Classification of Modeling Issues
Abstract. Modeling Computer-interpretable Clinical Guidelines (CIGs) entails
the need to involve a heterogeneous group of professionals in the tasks required,
mainly knowledge engineers and physicians, but possibly others (e.g. nurses, patient
associations). The workflow process followed by the team is diverse, depending
on who raise an issue, demand a requirement, introduce expert criteria
deviating from the guideline, solve a bug, detect a duplicate, etc. Follow-up of
this process is one of the challenges, as responsibilities are fuzzy and traditional
communication via skype meetings or e-mail sometimes is not efficient enough.
In this position paper we describe a preliminary label taxonomy to support classification
of modeling issues and to facilitate collaborative formalization of CIGs.
The taxonomy was designed during a project where a PROForma CIG model for
hyponatremia diagnosis and classification was formalized. Beyond tracking and
organizing issues, the use of this taxonomy might facilitate analysis of modeling
events and time efforts.
