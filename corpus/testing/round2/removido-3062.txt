Using defect taxonomies for requirements validation in industrial projects
Abstract:  Quality of requirements is of great importance for the software development lifecycle as it influences all steps of software development. To ensure various quality attributes, suitable requirements validation techniques such as reviews or testing are essential. In this paper, we show how defect taxonomies can improve requirements reviews and testing. We point out how defect taxonomies can be seamlessly integrated into the requirements engineering process and discuss requirements validation with defect taxonomies as well as its benefits and the lessons learned with reference to industrial projects of a public health insurance institution where this approach has been successfully applied.
