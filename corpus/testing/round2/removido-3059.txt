A multiple case study on risk-based testing in industry
Abstract  In many development projects, testing has to be conducted under severe pressure due to limited resources and a challenging time schedule. Risk-based testing, which utilizes identified risks of the system for testing purposes, has a high potential to improve testing as it helps to optimize the allocation of resources and provides decision support for management. But for many organizations, the integration of a risk-based approach into established testing activities is a challenging task, and there are several options to do so. In this article, we analyze how risk is defined, assessed, and applied to support and improve testing activities in projects, products, and processes. We investigate these questions empirically by a multiple case study of currently applied risk-based testing activities in industry. The case study is based on three cases from different backgrounds, i.e., a test project in context of the extension of a large Web-based information system, product testing of a measurement and diagnostic equipment for the electrical power industry, as well as a test process of a system integrator of telecommunication solutions. By analyzing and comparing these different industrial cases, we draw conclusions on the state of risk-based testing and discuss possible improvements.
