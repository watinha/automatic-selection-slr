What Influences Usability Defect Reporting? ï¿½ A Survey of Software Development Practitioners
Abstract:
Software development organizations invest in test automation tools and methods to optimize defect discovery rates. The true value of these tools is realized when the defects are addressed before release, and hence good quality defect reports are critical. We describe a survey we conducted to better understand usability defect reporting, in particular, influences on the quality of usability defect reports. We analyze feedback from nearly 150 software developers and usability defect reporters and identify key determinants of quality defect reports, aspects of usability defects that are challenging to report and directions for future research into usability defect reporting tools to improve usability defect reports quality.
