Weaving Social Software Features into Enterprise Resource Planning Systems
Abstract
In this paper we present the Social Weaver platform that enables end users to weave snippets of social software features into the workflows of existing enterprise applications. We discuss the underlying vision from a technological viewpoint, i.e., an end-user development viewpoint, and an organizational viewpoint which is about a certain ubiquitous understanding of enterprise application integration. We present the system's requirements, architecture and realization. The concrete platform is based on the standard web technology stack, which makes sense because the web is the current natural host for enterprise applications, at least for new ones. However, the approach presented in this article is technological-independent with the concrete platform as a concrete instance proving the approach as doable. Conceptually, the realized platform is a key to analyze the current situation and possible future of today's enterprise application landscapes which oscillate between emerging social software metaphors and an ever increasing degree of process automation found in today's organizations.
