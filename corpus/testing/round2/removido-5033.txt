A Preliminary Study on Factors Affecting Software Testing Team Performance
Abstract:  With the growth of the software testing industry, many in-house testing groups and outsourcing testing companies have been established. Underlying the success of these testing groups and companies are team(s) of testers. This research investigates the importance of different factors, diversity and experience on building a successful testing team. We collected the opinions of testing practitioners on these factors via a survey. The outcome strongly indicates the relative importance of different factors and that diversity is helpful for a testing team. The results also support the importance of suitable team experience.
