Identifying some problems with selection of software testing techniques
Testing techniques refer to different methods or ways of testing particular features of a computer  program, system or product. Presently there are so many different software testing techniques that we  can use. Whether we decide to automate or just execute tests manually, there is a selection of testing  techniques to choose from. We have to make sure that we select technique(s) that will help to ensure  the most efficient and effective testing of the system. The fundamental problem in software testing thus  throws an open question, as to what would be the techniques that we should adopt for an efficient and  effective testing. Thus, the selection of right testing techniques at the right time for right problem will  make the software testing efficient and effective. In this paper we discuss how should testing techniques  be compared with one another and why do we face a problem in making appropriate testing technique  selection.
