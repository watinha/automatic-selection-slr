A scoping study on the 25 years of research into software testing in Brazil and an outlook on the future of the area
Abstract  Over the past 25 years the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES) has evolved to become the most important event on software engineering in Brazil. Throughout these years, SBES has gathered a large body of studies in software testing. Aimed at providing an insightful understanding of what has already been published in such event, we have synthesized its 25-year history of research on software testing. Using information drawn from this overview we highlighted which software testing topics have been the most extensively surveyed in SBES literature. We have also devised a co-authorship network to depict the most prolific research groups and researchers. Moreover, by performing a citation analysis of the selected studies we have tried to ascertain the importance of SBES in a wider scenario. Finally, using the information extracted from the studies, we have shed light on the state-of-the-art of software testing in Brazil and provided an outlook on its foreseeable future.
