Estimating the Cost and Benefit of Model-Based Testing: A Decision Support Procedure for the Application of Model-Based Testing in Industry
Abstract:
Model-based testing is of high practical relevance and many model-based testing approaches have been developed during the last years. But the key question under which conditions model-based testing pays off and a related decision support procedure for its application has not been sufficiently addressed. In this paper we develop a generic decision support procedure whether to apply model-based testing in a project or not. The decision support procedure compares estimated costs and benefits of model-based testing throughout all phases of the test process and is derived on the basis of a case study performed at the European Space Agency.
