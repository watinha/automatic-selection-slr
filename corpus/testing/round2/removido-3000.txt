Sistemas embebidos en red seguros
The expansion of the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) increases the number of possible security vulnerabilities. This is the reason why it is important to provide methods and tools that facilities the design and the analysis of the WSNs. This thesis presents different techniques to be used during their development process. The first part of the thesis proposes a Wireless Sensor Network Analysis framework that estimates the WSN security. The second part of the thesis presents techniques to develop secure and efficient WSN firmware. These techniques are focused on the design of attack-aware firmware, the improvement of the security during the booting process and the increase in the performance of the WSN update process. The last part of the thesis presents a verification methodology that allows reusing the tests in different phases of the design process.
