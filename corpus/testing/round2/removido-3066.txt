Living in two different worlds: A comparison of industry and academic focus areas in software testing
Abstract:
The level of joint industry-academia collaborations in SE is, unfortunately, very low, compared to the amount of activities in each of the two communities. In their ongoing efforts to find the root-causes of this issue, the authors compare the focus areas of industry and academia in software testing, as represented by the titles of talks (papers) from a set of selected conferences in each of the two communities. Our comparisons show that the two groups are talking about quite different things. For example, when practitioners talk about test automation, they mostly refer to automating the test execution phase. However, academic worksï¿½ on automated approaches are mostly focused on test-case generation and test oracles. We also suggest what we can do to improve things, for example, researchers are advised to use the principles of Action Research in their research, especially when collaborating with industry, to ensure that the research problems are chosen from the actual needs of the industry, and that the research outputs will actually be used and benefit their industrial collaborators.
