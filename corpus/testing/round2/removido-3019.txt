Communication Performance Tests in Distributed Control Systems
Abstract
The paper presents a concept and implementation of Communication Performance Tests (CPT) for small distributed control systems. Requirements for the communication performance are specified using SysML notation. Test cases included in the specification are translated into a dedicated test definition language CPTest+. System implementation is then verified by executing the tests generated from the specification and analyzing results of test runs. The procedure is supported by specialized tools integrated with IEC 61131-3 development environment, including SysML model editor and CPTest testing environment.
