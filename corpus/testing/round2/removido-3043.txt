Testing Techniques Selection: A Systematic Approach
ABSTRACT
Software testing is vital and challenging activity in SDLC. The
complexity and size of the software is increasing multi-fold. A
multitude of techniques have been proposed for software
testing, but the key problem in software testing is the selection
of most effective technique. A great deal of research has been
carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
various testing techniques. However, up to now no study was
able to present a universally acceptable solution. As no testing
technique provides a single, comprehensive solution; the
selection must be done according to a given state. We present
here a decision support approach for selecting the most
suitable testing technique on the basis of number of identified
factors that influence the selection of appropriate techniques.
Selection of testing techniques based on factors identified in
this paper can improve the effectiveness of testing process
significantly.
