A Review of Two Experiences from Applying Model Based Testing in Practice
Abstract:  Model based testing (MBT) techniques have been used extensively to enable automatic and systematic test data generation. Despite many success stories, MBT still suffers from the lack of a broader practical adoption. This paper reports on two experiences of applying MBT for test data generation in industrial contexts. We give our view on some of the reasons affecting MBT practical adoption, discuss the perspectives for facilitating the adoption of MBT in industrial settings and summarize some of the barriers that remain to be surpassed. The goal of the paper is to provide a greater understanding of MBT in industry, potentially increasing its practical adoption.
