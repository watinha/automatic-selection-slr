Exploring Organizations' Software Quality Assurance Strategies
Abstract  Poor software quality leads to lost profits and even loss of life. U.S. organizations lose  billions of dollars annually because of poor software quality. The purpose of this multiple  case study was to explore the strategies that quality assurance (QA) leaders in small  software development organizations used for successful software quality assurance  (SQA) processes. A case study provided the best research design to allow for the  exploration of organizational and managerial processes. The target population group was  the QA leaders of 3 small software development organizations who successfully  implemented SQA processes, located in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. The  conceptual framework that grounded this study was total quality management (TQM)  established by Deming in 1980. Face-to-face semistructured interviews with 2 QA  leaders from each organization and documentation including process and training  materials provided all the data for analysis. NVivo software aided a qualitative analysis  of all collected data using a process of disassembling the data into common codes,  reassembling the data into themes, interpreting the meaning, and concluding the data. The  resulting major themes were Agile practices, documentation, testing, and lost profits.  The results were in contrast to the main themes discovered in the literature review,  although there was some overlap. The implications for positive social change include the  potential to provide QA leaders with the strategies to improve SQA processes, thereby  allowing for improved profits, contributing to the organizationsï¿½ longevity in business,  and strengthening the local economy.
