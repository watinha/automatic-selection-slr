Optimize defect detection techniques through empirical software engineering method
Abstract:  This paper introduces twelve defect detection techniques and describes a non-controlled experiment related to defect detection techniques to address the uncertainty of how to test an embedded software and find defects effectively. In this non-controlled experiment, three common testing techniques were applied to a large scale embedded system. This study is intended to evaluate different defect detection techniques that are actually used by software engineers using empirical software engineering method. The objective of empirical software engineering is to improve the software development processes and quality. This could be done by evaluating, comparing and controlling defect detection methods. This study is also intended to find a best method to reduce defects and increase the defect detection rate in a large scale embedded system, since defect detection is considered as one of the most costly development process in software development cycle
