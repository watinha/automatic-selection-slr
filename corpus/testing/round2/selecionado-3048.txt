Integrating Verification and Validation Techniques Knowledge into Software Engineering Environments
Abstract. Accomplishing software verification and validation (V&V) activities
is not a simple task. It involves a great number of techniques to choose and
there is no sufficient organized information to support the selection regarding
the V&V technique to be used. This paper describes an ongoing research work
concerned with the definition of an approach to plan verification and validation
processes. Its objective is to define how V&V activities can be supported
throughout software development processes accomplished by a Software
Engineering Environment (SEE). Besides V&V knowledge integrated into the
SEE, this approach will also organize some practical recommendations
generated by experimental studies regarding V&V techniques to support their
use.
