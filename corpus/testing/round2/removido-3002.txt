SABiO: Systematic Approach for Building Ontologies
Abstract. This paper presents the version 2.0 of SABiO - a Systematic Approach
for Building Ontologies. SABiO focus on the development of domain
ontologies, and propose also support and management processes, which are
strongly linked to the development process. SABiO distinguishes between reference
and operational ontologies, providing activities that apply to the development
of both types of domain ontologies.
