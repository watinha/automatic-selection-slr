A Literature Review and Classification of Selected Software Engineering Researches
In this paper, a literature review and classification scheme for selected software engineering researches is presented. The  study shows that an increasing volume of software engineering researches have been conducted in diverse range of areas. The  articles are classified and results of these are presented based on classification scheme that consist of five main categories:  software development process, software management, software engineering techniques, software re-engineering, and  software applications. Analyses of the selected researches are carried out and gaps in the research are identified. A  comprehensive list of references is presented. This review is intended to provide impetus in research and help simulate  further interest.
