Systematic selection of quality attribute techniques
Various techniques are used to investigate, evaluate, and control product quality risks throughout software development process. These "Quality Attribute Techniques" are used during all stages of the software development life cycle to ensure that acceptable levels of product qualities such as safety and performance are in place. In this paper, we propose a method to select from among the alternatives of these techniques. This method is based on Risk Management theory and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach. We apply our method to an example of real-world safety system presented in the literature. We identify advantages and limitations of the method, and discuss future research.
