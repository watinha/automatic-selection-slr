Software Testing Research and Practice
Abstract
The paper attempts to provide a comprehensive view of the field of software testing. The objective is to put all the relevant issues into a unified context, although admittedly the overview is biased towards my own research and expertise. In view of the vastness of the field, for each topic problems and approaches are only briefly tackled, with appropriate references provided to dive into them. I do not mean to give here a complete survey of software testing. Rather I intend to show how an unwieldy mix of theoretical and technical problems challenge software testers, and that a large gap exists between the state of the art and of the practice.
