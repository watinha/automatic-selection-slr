A state-of-practice questionnaire on verification and validation for concurrent programs
Research in verification and validation (V&V) for concurrent programs can be guided by practitioner information. A survey was therefore run to gain state-of-practice information in this context. The survey presented in this paper collected state-of-practice information on V&V technology in concurrency from 35 respondents. The results of the survey can help refine existing V&V technology by providing a better understanding of the context of V&V technology usage. Responses to questions regarding the motivation for selecting V&V technologies can help refine a systematic approach to V&V technology selection.
