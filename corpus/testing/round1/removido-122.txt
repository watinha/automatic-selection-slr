Evolving a Computerized Infrastructure to support the Selection of Model-Based Testing Techniques
Abstract. This paper describes a computerized infrastructure to support the  combined selection of Model-based Testing (MBT) Techniques to be jointly  used for a software project. The decision making can be supported by a  selection approach providing the generation of indicators and charts which MBT  techniques could be considered regarding the software project's characteristics  and requirements. Results of an observational study performed with software  engineers suggest the proposed infrastructure could be able to guide the  selection of the best-suited combination of MBT techniques for a software  project, can reduce about 50% of the selection time in comparison with manual  selection, and can approximate the time spent by software engineers with  different experience backgrounds while performing the MBT selection task.
