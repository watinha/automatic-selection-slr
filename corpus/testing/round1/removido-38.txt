Knowledge Management Applied to Software Testing: A Systematic Mapping
Abstract - With the growth of data from several different sources of knowledge within an organization, it becomes necessary to provide computerized support for tasks of acquiring, processing, analyzing and disseminating knowledge. In the software process, testing is a critical factor for product quality, and thus there is an increasing concern in how to improve the accomplishment of this task. In software testing, finding relevant knowledge to reuse can be a difficult and complex task, due to the lack of a strategy to represent or to associate semantics to a large volume of test data, including test cases, testing techniques to be applied and so on. This paper aims to investigate, through a Systematic Mapping of the Literature, some aspects associated with applying Knowledge Management to Software Testing.
