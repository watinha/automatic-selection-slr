Principles and Good Practices for Using Wikis within Organizations
Abstract  This chapter discusses the basic properties of corporate Wikis that make them an effective learning and knowledge management tool. Wikis offer a user-friendly environment that enhances informal knowledge sharing and the collaborative creation of new knowledge. Enterprise-wide adoption of Wikis promotes the reuse of existing know-hows and prevents employee re-invention of the wheel. Four cases of successful implementations of Wikis in large, hi-tech global organizations are described in detail including their goals, design considerations, implementation and actual use for formal and informal knowledge creation and sharing. The adoption and long-term sustainability of Wikis is attributed to perceived business outcomes by managers and to perceived usefulness and ease of use by individual contributors and users. Good practices based on one or more of these use-cases can provide practical guidance to organizations that wish to use a Wiki for KM purposes.
