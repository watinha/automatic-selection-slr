A CHARACTERIZATION APPROACH TO SELECTING VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION TECHNIQUES FOR SIMULATION PROJECTS
ABSTRACT  Conducting verification and validation (V&V) of modeling and simulation (M&S) requires systematic  and structured application of different V&V techniques throughout the M&S life cycle. Whether an  existing technique is appropriate to a particular V&V activity depends not only on the characteristics of  the technique but also on the situation where it will be applied. This work proposes a characterization  approach to identifying and specifying the information relevant for selecting V&V techniques by means  of an M&S-specific characterization schema. Based on the proposed schema, an application catalog that  works as an information repository for V&V techniques selection is established. This characterization is  applicable to any simulation study with well defined and structured model development and V&V processes.
