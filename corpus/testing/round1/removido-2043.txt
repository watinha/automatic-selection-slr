A Picture from the Model-Based Testing Area: Concepts, Techniques, and Challenges
Abstract  Model-Based Testing (MBT) represents a feasible and interesting testing strategy where test cases are generated from formal models describing the software behavior/structure. The MBT field is continuously evolving, as it could be observed in the increasing number of MBT techniques published at the technical literature. However, there is still a gap between researches regarding MBT and its application in the software industry, mainly occasioned by the lack of information regarding the concepts, available techniques, and challenges in using this testing strategy in real software projects. This chapter presents information intended to support researchers and practitioners reducing this gap, consequently contributing to the transfer of this technology from the academia to the industry. It includes information regarding the concepts of MBT, characterization of 219 MBT available techniques, approaches supporting the selection of MBT techniques for software projects, risk factors that may influence the use of these techniques in the industry together with some mechanisms to mitigate their impact, and future perspectives regarding the MBT field.
