Estrategia para Apoiar a Selecao de Abordagens de Teste Baseado em Modelos para Projetos de Software
Abstract. Software technologies, such as model-based testing approaches,
have specific characteristics and limitations that can affect their use in
software projects. It is very important to make available knowledge regarding
such technologies aiming at to support its applicability in software projects. In
particular, a choice of model-based testing approach can influence testing
success or failure. Therefore, this paper presents the knowledge acquired from
some secondary and primary studies regarding model-based testing
approaches and the proposal of a strategy towards supporting their selection
for software projects.
