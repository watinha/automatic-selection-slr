The relationship between organizational learning and organizational *change: Analyzing adult learning and organizational learning factors
One of the methods to achieve organization change and improvement has been organizational learning, and there has been much written about this subject. The benefits of organizational learning theory have not been sufficiently quantified in the extant literature. Therefore, the topic to which this study was directed is the relationship between organizational learning and organizational change. There is much literature in support of the benefits of organizational learning. Senge (1990a), Argyris and Schon (1974), Marsick and Watkins (1999), Knowles et al. (1998) and many others have laid out theoretical frameworks in the literature. Authors such a Jashapara (2003), Cameron & Whetten (1983), B.T. Phillips (2003) and others have noted the lack of quantifiable data in the literature in support of this theory. This study evaluated; (a) The relationship between organizational learning and organizational change success, (b) the relationship between organizational learning and adult learning, (c) the relationship between adult learning and organizational change success, and (d) the relationship between the combination of adult learning and organizational learning and organizational change success.
