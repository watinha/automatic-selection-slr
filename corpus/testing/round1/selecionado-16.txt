A knowledge management approach for testing open source software systems
Abstract: The development of open source software (OSS), and their deployment by general public as well as by different types of organizations, has increased manifold over the past decade or so. In spite of the ubiquity of OSS, the quality of many OSS remains questionable. Testing provides a curative approach for OSS quality assurance, and a comprehensive approach to testing is a knowledge-intensive endeavor. The management of knowledge in the OSS test process forms a perpetual cycle of creation, dissemination, and acquisition of test knowledge.
