A Generic Model-Based Methodology of Testing Techniques to Obtain High Quality Software
Testing techniques have been widely used as a method to help software engineers in detecting defects in a software system in order to develop high-quality software system and achieve customer satisfaction. Different techniques reveal different quality aspects of a software system. This paper proposes a model-based methodology of the major accepted categories of testing techniques to evaluate many aspects like functional, structural, reliability, usability requirements and check their consistency. Evaluating all these aspects in a software project will help ensure the success of such software development project and will also assist software testers in error handling in order to achieve the desired quality for software customers.
