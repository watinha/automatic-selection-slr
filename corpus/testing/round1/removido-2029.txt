An Iterative Empirical Strategy for the Systematic Selection of a Combination of Verification and Validation Technologies
Abstract:
The rapid development of verification and validation (V&V) has resulted in a multitude of V&V technologies, making V&V selection difficult for practitioners. Since most V&V technologies will be combined it is important to be aware of how they should be combined and the cost-effectiveness of these combinations. This paper presents a strategy for selecting and evaluating particular V&V combinations that focuses on maximising completeness and minimising effort. The strategy includes a systematic approach for applying empirical information regarding the costs and capabilities of V&V technologies.
