A Schema Support for Selection of Test Case Prioritization Techniques
Abstract:  Regression testing is a vast field of research. It is very costly and time consuming process but on the other hand very important process in software testing. Retest all, Test case Selection, Hybrid and Test Case Prioritization are its various techniques which are used to reduce the efforts in maintenance phase. In technical literature several techniques are present with their different and vast number of goals which can be applied in software projects despite of that they have not proven their true efficiency in the testing process. The major problem in regression testing area is to select the test case prioritization technique/s that is effective in such a way that maximum project characteristics should be cover in a minimum time span. However, consideration of this decision be carefully done so that loss of resources can be avoided in a software project. Based on the above scenario, author proposes a selection schema to support the selection of TCP techniques for a given software project aiming at maximizing the coverage of software project characteristics considering aspect of prioritization of software project characteristics. At the end, preliminary results of an experimental evaluation are presented. The purpose of this research is decision should be based on the objective knowledge of the techniques rather than considering some perception and assumptions.
