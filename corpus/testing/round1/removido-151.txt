A DESIGN AND A PROTOTYPE FOR A MOBILE INFORMATION SERVICE FOR TOURISTS
Tourism is one of the biggest industry branches with billions of tourists
traveling every year around the world. Therefore, solutions providing
tourist information have to be up to date with both changes in the industry
and the world's technological progress. The aim of this thesis is
to present a design and a prototype of a tourist mobile service which is
individual-oriented, cost-free for the end user, and secure.

On the information providers' side, the solution is implemented as a Webbased
database. The end users access the information through a Bluetooth
application on their mobile devices. The Bluetooth-based solution allows
to avoid any costs for the end users, that is tourists. The study shows that,
even with small data transfers, the tourists could save significantly when
compared to possible roaming charges for data transfer. Also, the proposed
mobile service is not intrusive, as it is provided through an application
installed by tourists voluntarily on their mobile devices.
Through design and implementation this work shows that it is possible to
build a system which can be used to provide information services to tourists
through mobile phones. The work achieved a successful ongoing synchronization
between the client and the server databases. Implementation and
usage were limited to smart phones only, as they provide better technological
support for the solution having features like maps, GPS, Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and Databases. Moreover, the design of this system shows how
Bluetooth technology can be used effectively as a means of communication
while minimizing its shortcomings and risks, such as security, by bypassing
Bluetooth server service discovery protocol (SDP) and connecting directly
to the device.
Apart from showing the design and implementation of the end-user costfree
mobile information service, the results of this work also highlight the
possible business opportunities to the provider of the service.
