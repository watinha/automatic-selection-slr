Development of a method to improve the definition and alignment of intangible project outcomes and tangible project outputs
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe a doctoral research study, including a summary of key literature review topics, the application of an action research methodology, key research findings and potential areas of future research. Design/methodology/approach: Research reported in this paper was based upon a series of five cycles of action research. Findings: An Outcome Profile template can be used to guide project stakeholders through the process of identifying, defining and aligning intangible project outcomes with tangible project outputs. Practical implications: The research study will advance general management and project management research and practice by providing organisations with an improved template and method for linking project stakeholders' outcomes and benefits?based perspective of project success with the more traditional project management outputs?based perspective of project success. The research study, in itself provides a how?to guide. Originality/value: This paper alerts practitioners and academics to this recent research work to improve the definition of intangible project outcomes; to better determine what value a given project is expected to deliver.
