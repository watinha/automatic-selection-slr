Wiki as a Knowledge Management Tool: The Case of a Non?Profit Administrative Entity
Abstract: In order to maintain their survival and prosperity, organizations must understand the importance of knowledge. Knowledge management is the study of how organizations create and transform knowledge in order to achieve a competitive advantage. The development of communication and information technology has allowed an increasing cooperation and interaction of the knowledge flux inside the organizational environment. Wiki is one of the technological tools which have been highlighted because it allows companies to boost their knowledge related processes. This investigation studied how Wikis are used as a knowledge management tool, in the organizational environment of a public non profit company (thus departing from studies that are centered on private companies). Our theoretical development highlights the relevance of KM models, namely the SECI model. Using the SECI model we were able to identify the importance of this tool for the creation of knowledge and the overall performance of the users, showing that it increased their autonomy and efficiency.
