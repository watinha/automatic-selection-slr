Achieving Software Engineering Knowledge Items with an Unit Testing Approach
Abstract-- Classification makes a vital role to advancing
knowledge in both science and engineering. It is a process of
investigating the relationships between the objects to be
classified and identifies gaps in knowledge. Classification in
engineering also has a practical application. They can help
maturing Software Engineering knowledge, as classifications
constitute an organized structure of knowledge items. Till date,
in existing system, there have been few attempts at classifying in
test cases. In this research, we examine how useful classifications
in Software Engineering are for advancing knowledge by trying
to classify testing techniques. This paper presents a preliminary
classification of a set of unit testing techniques. To obtain this
classification, we enacted a generic process for developing useful
Software Engineering classifications. The proposed
classification has been proven useful for maturing knowledge
about testing techniques. SE helps to: 1) provide a systematic
description of the techniques,2) understand testing techniques
by studying the relationships among techniques (measured in
terms of differences and similarities), 3) identify potentially
useful techniques that do not yet exist by analyzing gaps in the
classification, and 4) support practitioners in testing technique
selection by matching technique characteristics to project
characteristics.
