Different contributor profiles in an organizational wiki
Knowledge management (KM) has an increasing importance in organizations. Not only as a way to capture knowledge, but also to allow the incorporation of knowledge in products and services provided. Wikis are finding their way into organizational departments serving as collaborative tools for knowledge creation. In this paper, as a future work of previous research, we study how an organizational wiki can be used as a knowledge management tool and how can it serve KM codification strategy purposes.
