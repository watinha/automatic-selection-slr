An Object and Performance Framework for Implementation of Web-based Knowledge Sharing Technology
Abstract: Any e-organization, whether it is commercial or governmental, requires a knowledge management support in order to achieve optimal performance. Many of the technologies that serve the operations of such organizations can also support knowledge management to facilitate efficient knowledge sharing and reuse. Thus, e-organizations should be at the forefront in the use of knowledge management. This paper examines systems of knowledge management used in large organizations. The limitations of traditional organizational schemes are examined, including the tie to the traditional pre-digital knowledge unit, the multi-page document. An action research approach is taken towards the question of how we improve upon traditional approaches using the technology available in conjunction with approaches arising from organizational research. A new framework is described where knowledge is packaged into objects and classified by organizational performance roles and goals. A prototype implementation of the framework was developed in order to test its feasibility. Evaluation of the prototype suggests that the system could result in a more intuitive organizational framework that enables workers to obtain appropriate knowledge support in a timely manner without the need for extensive search, and also facilitates greater reuse and sharing of knowledge.
