PROCEDIMENTO PARA APOIO A SELECAO DE CRITERIOS DE PARADA PARA TESTES DE SOFTWARE
This work proposes a procedure to support the stopping criterion selection for
software testing regarding the matching of characteristcs presented by a software
project and the stopping criteria organized into a body of knowledge. Such body of
knowledge has been organized to contain relevant information acquired through a
quasi-systematic literature review concerned with 74 stopping criteria for software
testing. The stored information includes the attributes used for comparison between
software projects and stopping criteria. By considering such attributes, the stopping
criteria can be filtered according to the defined characteristics of the software project.
Next, for each filtered criterion, an adequacy degree suggesting the level of adequacy
(conceptual distance) between a stopping criterion and the software project is
calculated by comparing the equivalente attributes characterizing both the software
project and stopping criterion. Aiming to make easier its use, the proposed procedure
has been implemented and integrated into a test management and monitoring CASE
tool called Maraka. Its use has been exemplified by a proof of concept using different
projects contexts including one real application.
