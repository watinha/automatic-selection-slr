Developing Software Technologies through Experimentation: Experiences from the Battlefield 
Abstract. To make software technologies available to support software development  process with quality in the industry represents one of the most important goals in  software engineering. However, the mere providing of the software technology is  not enough. It is necessary to produce evidence on the software technology  feasibility and applicability in the different development contexts. Therefore, for a  technology to be made available it is necessary that it goes through three stages:  conception, construction and evaluation. Approaches to construct and evaluate  software technologies are easily found in the technical literature. However, this is  not the case with the conception stage. This paper describes an approach concerned  with the conception of software technologies based on evidence collected from  secondary and primary studies to support their development. The types of study and  decision points are presented to allow their evaluation and application by software  engineers.
