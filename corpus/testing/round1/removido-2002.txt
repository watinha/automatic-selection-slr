Knowledge Management Systems Based on Topic Maps Theory
The aim of the paper is to summarize the experience gained from the research and the constructions of the Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) based on the ontology engineering. Computational ontologies are the means to formally model the structure of a system, to discover the entities and relations that emerge from its observation, and which are useful to the system purposes. In our projects, we utilize the Topic Maps Theory and the tools based on this technology (e.g. ATOM2). The key point of the solution is the ontology development; our methodology procedure is presented; the improvement of the methodology and the future research goals are oriented to automate the procedure steps. During the process, the text mining tools (e.g. TOVEK) and other analytical tools are used. At the end of the paper, the summary of the experience with the methodology application is presented.
