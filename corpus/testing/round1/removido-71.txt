Organizational wiki as a knowledge management tool
Knowledge management has an increasing importance in organizations. Not only as a way to capture knowledge, but also to allow the incorporation of knowledge in products and services provided. Wikis are finding their way into organizational departments serving as collaborative tools for knowledge creation. In this paper, we study how an organizational wiki can be used as a knowledge management (KM) tool from the point of view of two KM models. A survey was conducted in a corporate IT department. It was used to identify the processes of the SECI model and the contexts of the four competencies of a learning organization in which wikis can be used.
