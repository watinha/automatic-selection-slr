Automatic Change Recommendation of Models and Meta Models Based on Change Histories
Model-driven software engineering uses models and meta models as key artefacts in the software development process. Typically, changes in the models (or meta models) do not come in isolation but are part of more complex change sets where a single change depends on other changes, e.g., a component is added to an architectural model and thereafter ports and connectors connect this component to other components. Furthermore, these sets of related and depending changes are often recurring, e.g., always when a component is added to an architecture, it is highly likely that ports are added to that component, too. This is similar for changes in meta models. Our goal is to help engineers by (1) automatically identifying clusters of related changes on model histories and (2) recommending corresponding changes after the engineer performs a single change. In this position paper, we present an initial technique to achieve our goal. We evaluate our technique with models from the Eclipse GMF project and present our recommendations as well as the recommendation quality. Our evaluation found an average precision between 0.43 and 0.82 for our recommendations.
