CaracterIsticas de Tecnicas de Teste de Software para Uso em Projetos WEB
Abstract. Small and large scale Web applications have been built along the
years influencing the conventional software engineering approaches and
demanding care with additional quality issues such as verification, validation
and testing. Regarding software testing, the results of a secondary study have
pointed out at least 71 different testing techniques specifically applicable to
Web software projects. Hence, the diversity of Web applications and
development methodologies combined with the great number of available
software testing techniques make hard the decision about which technique
should be used in the project. Therefore, the understanding of testing techniques
characteristics can support the decision making and represents an interesting
research challenge. Based on this, this paper presents a set of Web software
testing techniques characteristics synthesized from the results of a secondary
study and evaluated through a survey with specialists in the field. It represents
an initial result towards the organization of a Web application testing techniques
characterization schema, which intends to support the choosing of suitable
software testing techniques for a Web software project.
