A survey: Optimal approaches for distributed software testing
Abstract
Numerous advancements in semantic web technologies initiate the new research area in Software Engineering (SE) applications. Various methods, tools available to create the systematic, disciplined structure of software. SE contains three processes, namely, construction, testing and maintenance. The systematic creation of meaningful software by using coding, debugging and verification refers to construction. The maintenance process analyzes and modifies the software products to improve the performance of attributes. The crucial step in between construction and maintenance is software testing. A process that identifies the bugs, errors and defects in software refer testing. This paper presents the detailed survey of the testing process and influence of testing in SE applications. Also, this highlights the cloud deployment, clustering, generation/selection/prioritization of test cases in automated software testing. The survey addresses the testing order of test cases during grouping process in distributed server testing. Moreover, the case selection for the complete testing process is the complex task. Clustering mechanism improves the grouping processes based on dependency analysis in test case generation and selection. This paper also addresses the prediction of testing sequence based on dependency information and fitness function through test prioritization techniques. This survey focuses how to create an optimal distributed test bed for real world software applications.
