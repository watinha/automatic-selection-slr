Applying Knowledge Management Approach for Software Testing
Software testing involves the process of detecting software discrepancies so that they can be corrected before they are installed into a live environment supporting operational business units. To better support this complex task of software-testing, this study proposes identifying and applying a knowledge management (KM) approach to software testing. Based on literature review, three frameworks are identified, each of which was used in a project based environment. An integrated hybrid KM framework for software testing is developed by incorporating desirable aspects of the first two frameworks into the third one. To assess the effectiveness of the hybrid framework, an empirical study needs to be conducted.
