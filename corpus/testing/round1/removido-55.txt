An EFL On-line Writing: Exploring Its Gains
This study examined an EFL on-line writing programme with its automated feedback in terms of the students writing progress, the discrepancy between the on-line and teachers scores, and the teachers and students perceptions. Fifty seven EFL students aged 18-19 years old in an English-teacher education programme in Indonesia participated in the study. They completed eight practice writings and two writing tests using MY Access, an online writing programme. The analytical examination of their writing found that the students made progress most evidently in organization, as well as in content and development. A paired-sample t-test reported that the on-line programme and teachers scoring based on the same rubrics were significantly different, with the on-line programme giving higher grades than the teachers. The questionnaire and interview revealed that the teachers and students generally had a positive attitude towards the on-line programme, especially for its immediate feedback. Yet, three issues were repeatedly raised: 1) non-specific feedback, 2) overrated evaluations, and 3) the need for teacher feedback. The findings heighten the desirability for blended learning, and writing and feedback paradigm shifts. Writing should not only be placed on the cognitive plane but also be embedded in socio-cultural contexts. Feedback should helps the students develop their agency in writing and take ownership of it.
