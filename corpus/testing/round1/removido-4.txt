Modeling and automatic code generation for wireless sensor network applications using model-driven or business process approaches: A systematic mapping study
This systematic mapping study investigates the modeling and automatic code generation initiatives for wireless sensor network applications based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, trying to understand the reasons, characteristics and methods used in the approaches available in the scientific literature, identifying research gaps and potential approaches that can be better exploited, indicating new possibilities of research. The focus is on studies that follow the Model-Driven or Business Process approaches.
