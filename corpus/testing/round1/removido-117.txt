An approach for component testing and its empirical validation
The lack of information limits component consumers to understand candidate components sufficiently in a way they can check if a given component fulfills its goal. Thus, this paper presents an approach to support component testing aiming to reduce the lack of information between component producers and component consumers. Additionally, the approach is covered by a CASE tool integrated in the development environment. An experimental study was performed in order to evaluate its efficiency and difficulties of its use. The experimental study indicates that the approach is viable and the tool support provides effort reduction to component producers and component consumers.
