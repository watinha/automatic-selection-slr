Porantim: An approach to support the combination and selection of Model-based Testing techniques  Sign In or Purchase
Abstract:
The technical literature regarding Model-based Testing (MBT) has several techniques with different characteristics and goals available to be applied in software projects. Besides the lack of information regarding these techniques, they could be applied together in a software project aiming at improving the testing coverage. However, this decision needs to be carefully analyzed to avoid loss of resources in a software project. Based on this scenario, this paper proposes an approach with the purpose of supporting the unique or combined selection of MBT techniques for a given software project considering two aspects: the adequacy level between MBT techniques and the software project characteristics and impact of more than one MBT technique in some testing process variables. At the end, preliminary results of an experimental evaluation are presented.
