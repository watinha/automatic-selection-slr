A Framework for Learning Programming Using TQM
Abstract Computer programming is known for its complexity and difficulty among novice. Developing good computer programming skills requires students to do a lot of exercises. Besides, high self motivation is the only types of person that required in performing better in programming development. In this research, an exploration for PDCA cycle from manufacturing area will be transform into computer programming learning for continuous process improvements. Expected results from this study will reflect to the research questions. This paper contributed on the motivations of applying TQM to the programming earning using Problem-based learning through web-based environment. Therefore, we believe that constructive development through PBL and web-based programming learning tends to support cognitive development among novice.
