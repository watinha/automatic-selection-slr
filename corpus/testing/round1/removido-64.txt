A method for recommending computer-security training for software developers
The motivation for this research is the idea that training for each software developer should be in individually identified and focused areas of software security rather than a generalized security training for all developers. The main objective of our proposed system is to recommend precise and focused training articles to software developers. Our approach intends to help developers avoid unsafe coding practices in an efficient and effective way.
