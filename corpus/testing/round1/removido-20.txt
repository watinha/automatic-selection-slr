A Survey on Knowledge Management in Software Engineering
Abstract: Software development is a knowledge intensive and collaborative activity. The success of the project totally depends on knowledge and experience of the developers. Increasing knowledge creation and sharing among software engineers are uphill tasks in software development environments. The field of knowledge management has emerged into this field to improve the productivity of the software by effective and efficient knowledge creation, sharing and transferring. In other words, knowledge management for software engineering aims at facilitating knowledge flow and utilization across every phases of a software engineering process. Therefore, adaptation of various knowledge management practices by software engineering organizations is essential. This survey identified the knowledge management involvement in software engineering in different perspectives in the recent literature and guide future research in this area.
