Uma abordagem para testes de componentes apoiada por uma ferramenta CASE
The lack of information limits component consumers to understand
candidate components suficiently in a way they can check if a given
component fulfills its goal. Thus, this work presents an approach to
support component testing aiming to reduce the lack of information
between component producers and component consumers. Additionallu,
the approach is covered by a CASE tool integrated in the development
environment. An experimental study was performad in order to evaluate
is efficiency and difficulties of its use. The experimental study
indicates that the approach is viable and the tool support provides
effort reduction to component producers and component consumers.
