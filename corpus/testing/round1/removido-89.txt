Abordagem para Desenvolver Tecnologia de Software com Apoio de Estudos Secundarios e Primarios
Abstract. Minimizing risks in the development and introduction of new technologies
in the software industry can be considered an important factor to evolve software
engineering as science. The using of evidence provided by experimental studies
allows the characterization of a technology before its using in software projects in
the industry. Thus, it is possible to determine with reasonable precision the
feasibility in to use a software technology in specific scenarios. Based on this
context, this paper presents an approach that uses secondary and primary studies to
support the conception of new software technologies. Its applicability is evaluated
by the description of two experience cases. As consequence, some discussions are
presented regarding the difficulties, risks, and benefits in the using of the proposed
approach.
