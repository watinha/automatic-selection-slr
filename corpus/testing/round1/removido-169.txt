Global spread of usability expertise
Concern with usability in the design of technology has developed rapidly over the last decade. Although this concern has been mainly located in the U.S. and Western Europe, there is evidence of a global spread, and moves to outsource this activity. As marketplaces become global, it is necessary to adapt testing procedures for different cultures. This paper will illustrate the global spread of usability expertise by presenting data collected from usability testing centers and laboratories around the world. It will discuss the possibilities for future expansion and global networking of usability expertise and knowledge.
