An analysis of a comprehensive planning framework for customizing SQA
Software quality assurance (SQA) is an important part of software development that ensures the software quality. The effectiveness of the process is highly dependent on the technique(s) and tools(s) that are employed for the execution of the process. However, the choice of technique or tool to use is a hard and complicated decision that involves many factors. Research has been done to formalize the method of defining and characterizing these factors. In this paper we have analyzed the framework proposed by Frank Elberzhanger and Christian Denger. The shortcomings and limitations are highlighted and possible improvements are given. We further propose a new model/framework on the basis of above discussion.
