Una aproximacion basada en metamodelado del area de proceso de Validacion del CMMI: Un caso de estudio
In this article an approach to process improvement is established through the validation process area of CMMI, by focusing on making a metamodel. Validation process area was considered specifically, SG1 prepare for validation. By the metamodel, a taxonomy of projects, the testing characterization, the testing templates for the product to validate, for the validation environment, for the testing procedures and criteria, and a test plan are defined. The focus was subjected to evaluation by a case study. The case study was conducted in the IT Department of a public higher education institution. The approach proved its validity, since testers feel that it gives them specific tests for the development of the validation process and allows them to prepare validation for a particular project.
