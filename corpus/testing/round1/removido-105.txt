Supporting the selection of model-based testing approaches for software projects
Software technologies, such as model-based testing approaches, have specific characteristics and limitations that can affect their use in software projects. To make available knowledge regarding such technologies is important to support the decision regarding their use in software projects. In particular, a choice of model-based testing approach can influence testing success or failure. Therefore, this paper aims at describing knowledge acquired from a systematic review regarding model-based testing approaches and proposing an infrastructure towards supporting their selection for software projects.
