Semantic-Based Test Case Generation
Abstract: Software testing is a major V&V activity that revolves around quality test cases. Generating quality test cases is inherently knowledge intensive, tedious and expensive task that is traditionally done by humans. Therefore, a great deal of research has been done to facilitate and automate test case generation as much as possible. Given the knowledge intensity of software test case generation, various knowledge management techniques, such as semantic-based techniques, are applicable. The main focus of our research is automatic generation of quality test cases using available knowledge from the early stages of software development, i.e. the RE. Our goal is to develop a semantic web enabled framework for integrating knowledge from various requirement models to generate effective and efficient test cases automatically. We are going to apply semantic technology to facilitate the test case generation process by means of ontologies and Web of Data.
