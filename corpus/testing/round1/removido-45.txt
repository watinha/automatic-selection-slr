ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING APPLIED TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
Organizational learning assists the companies to improve significantly their processes by means of experiences reuse, making knowledge accessible to the whole organization. In software engineering it is important that the acquired knowledge is stored and systematically reused. This paper aims to present a systematic review, by identifying in which software engineering areas are the organizational learning studies concentrated, and how the organizational learning concepts are being applied in software engineering. This systematic review identified 2496 papers. After eliminating the duplicate titles and those not related to the review, 1184 papers remained. Applying the exclusion criteria, the number of papers was reduced to 68. These papers were analyzed and classified according to the software engineering areas defined in the SWEBOK, and the main organizational learning theories and techniques. It was observed that many software engineering researches apply organizational learning concepts without being aware of it.
