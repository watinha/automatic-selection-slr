ONTO-ResAsset Development: An Ontology for Reusable Assets Specification and Management
Abstract: Reuse is an important mechanism to increase productivity and to reduce time and costs during software development. Although source code is the most commonly reusable asset, other types of assets can also be reused, such as requirements, business processes, analysis and design models, etc. In this context, it is important that the knowledge about reusable assets and its management are available to potential stakeholders. This work presents the development of an ontology of reusable assets specification and management, named ONTO-ResAsset. This ontology is evaluated under two points-of-view: domain experts and non-experts.
