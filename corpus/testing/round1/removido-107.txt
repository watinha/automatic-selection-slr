Early Empirical Assessment of the Practical Value of GQM+Strategies
Abstract  The success of a measurement initiative in a software company depends on the quality of the links between metrics programs and organizational business goals. GQM+Strategies is a new approach designed to help in establishing links between the organizational business goals and measurement programs. However, there are no reported industrial experiences that demonstrate the practical value of the method. We designed a five-step research approach in order to assess the method's practical value. The approach utilized revised Bloom's taxonomy as a framework for assessing the practitioners cognition level of the concepts. The results of our study demonstrated that the method has practical value for the case company, and it is capable of addressing real-world problems. In the conducted empirical study, the cognition level of the practitioners was sufficient for a successful implementation of the method.
