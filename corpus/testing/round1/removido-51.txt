The Role of Testers in an Agile Software Development Life Cycle within B2B Companies
Abstract: High software quality is a very important outcome of software development practices for business customers (Mairiza, Zowghi, & Nurmuliani, 2010). This annotated bibliography is developed for software testers who want to improve the quality of software and customer satisfaction in the Agile development cycle. Selected references published between 2006 to 2013 are reviewed to examine software quality requirements, appropriate amounts of software tester readiness, test planning, verification of business test cases, and additional testing activities.
