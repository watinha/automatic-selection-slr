Measuring testing as a distributed component of the software life cycle
Abstract: We study software testing as a distributed component of the software life cycle, developing a technique for estimating testing validity. The goal of this paper is to build measures for testing result estimation, to find how tested properties influence software quality, and to develop means (methodology and algorithms) to achieve better results in testing. To achieve these goals, we suggest using system approach to testing developed in this paper and introduce a system of test efficiency measures, as well as discuss a methodology of how to use these measures. Properties of test efficiency measures oriented at the software engineering domain are studied. We also show (Proposition 1, Theorem 1 and their Corollaries) how logic can increase testing efficiency.
