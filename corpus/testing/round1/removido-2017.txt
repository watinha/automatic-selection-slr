Technology knowledge management (TKM) taxonomy: Using technology to manage knowledge in a Saudi municipality
Purpose  � Knowledge is a main resource of any organization. Knowledge management (KM) is identified by four processes: creating, capturing, distributing and sharing of knowledge. Technology can enable successful KM. The purpose of this paper is to propose a technology knowledge management (TKM) taxonomy, which lists popular electronic tools that can enhance KM processes and shows which tool can contribute to which processes.    Design/methodology/approach  � The taxonomy was developed by an extensive literature review of electronic KM tools and a three-year extensive analysis of different knowledge sources at the Jeddah Municipality (JM) in Saudi Arabia.    Findings  � The taxonomy can be used by practitioners developing an organizational KM system to guide them to choose a sufficient subset of tools that covers all four processes in order to ensure that no process is overlooked.    Research limitations/implications  � The result of using the TKM taxonomy and its effect on KM success is an interesting area for further research. However, the current value underlies in it offering practitioners a rough roadmap to an electronic KM system and aids in giving at least a starting point.    Practical implications  � The TKM taxonomy can be used by large scale organizations to guide in developing a KM system effectively and more efficiently. Furthermore, the JM KC is a good model for similar organizations to use, with all the tools explained in the paper.    Social implications  � The paper addresses some of the social elements related to successful KM in organizations. However, it is more technically targeted.    Originality/value  � Researchers have investigated either the holistic effect of IT on KM or described certain tools. The types of IT tools and their effect on KM have not been investigated. Furthermore, limited research addresses the design of effective KM systems and no tools exist to guide designers. The TKM taxonomy is a tool that can help KM practitioners and strategists to design effective KM systems efficiently, by guiding them in choosing tools that are suitable for certain KM processes. The paper also describes the JM Knowledge Center as a KMS model for organizations which addresses all four KM processes.
