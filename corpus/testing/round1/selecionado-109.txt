Using Defect Taxonomies to Improve the Maturity of the System Test Process: Results from an Industrial Case Study
Abstract
Defect taxonomies collect and organize the domain knowledge and project experience of experts and are a valuable instrument of system testing for several reasons. They provide systematic backup for the design of tests, support decisions for the allocation of testing resources and are a suitable basis for measuring the product and test quality. In this paper, we propose a method of system testing based on defect taxonomies and investigate how these can systematically improve the efficiency and effectiveness, i.e. the maturity of requirements-based testing. The method is evaluated via an industrial case study based on two projects from a public health insurance institution by comparing one project with defect taxonomy-supported testing and one without. Empirical data confirm that system testing supported by defect taxonomies (1) reduces the number of test cases, and (2) increases of the number of identified failures per test case.
