What prevents effective utilisation of customer knowledge in professional B-to-B services? An empirical study
Abstract  This article is based on a case study of a professional service organisation in the field of business-to-business education and consultancy services. This study contributes by increasing the knowledge of organisational inhibitors of customer knowledge utilisation in collaborative customer relationships by describing four organisational aspects inhibiting internal customer knowledge utilisation. The first is a professional service organisation's dominant logic, which refers to a barrier between organisation and customer. The second relates to cultural characteristics, referring to barriers between individuals and groups. The third barrier is the organisational structure of the professional service firm and the fourth barrier relates to systems and administrative routines.
