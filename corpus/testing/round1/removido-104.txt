Evaluation of {model-based} testing techniques selection approaches: An external replication
Abstract:
The selection of software technologies represents a risk factor to a software project. Therefore, using tailored software technologies to support this task can contribute to reduce the risk of inadequate choices made by software engineers. This paper presents the results of an experimental study conducted to evaluate if three dependent variables (selection time, % of correct choices, and used information) can be significantly affected by two different approaches to support the selection of Model-Based Testing techniques. This study consists of an external replication of an experiment conducted to evaluate two approaches for the selection of testing techniques. Therefore, we present the adaptations performed in the planning and design of the experiment and the challenges observed in conducting a study replication. The results indicated that the time spent to select MBT techniques and the percentage of right selections can be affected by the approach used to select MBT techniques for different software project categories.
