Managing Knowledge in Open Source Software Test Process
The increasing adoption and use of Open Source Software (OSS) motivates study of its development. This chapter explores the state-of-the art in OSS development processes, in general, and OSS testing processes, in particular. A conceptual model for software Testing Knowledge Management (TKM) that aims to provide an understanding of the testing domain is introduced. The TKM model is informed by earlier studies and guided by international testing standards. Moreover, the TKM model is equipped with different forms of knowledge, reusable across software projects. Using the TKM model as an integrative conceptual model enables understanding of how knowledge life cycle stages are mapped onto the test process of OSS, what type of knowledge is created at each stage, and how knowledge is converted from one stage to another. The chapter is supported by representative examples of OSS that are mature and currently in widespread use.
