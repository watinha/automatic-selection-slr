A chronological survey on combinatorial testing strategies
Combinatorial Testing (CT) can detect hard-to-find software faults triggered by interactions of parameters more efficiently than manual test case selection methods. It has been the active field of research today. Combinatorial strategy is a class of test case selection methods where test cases are identified by choosing values that satisfy the input criteria. Combinatorial Strategies are the test-case selection methods where the test cases are identified by combining those values to test object input parameters. This paper targets to review the previous work on CT, present the evolution of CT, presents a clear picture of combinatorial testing strategies with basic algorithms and identifies the important issues, methods and applications of CT that directs a pathway to future research in CT. This survey also includes a hierarchy that attempts to relate various criteria associated with combination strategies.
