Towards a reasoning framework for software product line testing
Testing can still be considered a bottleneck for software product line engineering. The variability implemented in the source artifacts increases its complexity. Due to its key role for product line quality, testing requires cost-effective practices, such as techniques for test selection should be produced to enable companies to experience the substantial production cost savings. In this paper, we present the outline of a Ph.D. research aimed at developing a reasoning framework to improve SPL testing practices. Based on multiple sources of evidence, the framework intends to provide testers with an automated reasoner for determining which techniques may be suitable for a given variability implementation mechanism, and how these should be employed in order to makes testing in a SPL a more effective and efficient practice. We plan to perform empirical evaluations in order to assess the proposal effectiveness.
