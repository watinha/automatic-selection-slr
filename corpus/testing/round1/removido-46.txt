Towards a quality model for the evaluation of DSS based on KDD process
Abstract: A Decision Support System (DSS) based on Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD) process is used to give confident knowledge to the final users in order to help them making right decisions. Such systems can be underused if the mined knowledge is unconfident, or if the system is hardly usable or unusable. Our target is to supply out a Quality Model (QM) ensuring a global evaluation of DSS based on KDD process (DSS/KDD). In our point of view, a QM should involve three dimensions: the evaluation of the DSS as a Software Product, as a User Interface and as a DSS. We should also take into account ISO recommendations. We intend to build a model which defines a set of criteria and allows measurement of a DSS/KDD quality evaluation using Goal-Question Method (GQM) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).
