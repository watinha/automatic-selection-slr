Systematic Review on Testing Aspect-orientedPrograms: Challenges, Techniques and Their Effectiveness
Aspect-oriented programming is a relatively new programming paradigm and it builds on the basis of object oriented programming paradigm. It deals with those concerns that cross-cut the modularity of traditional programming mechanisms and it aims at reduction of code and to provide higher cohesion. As with any new technology aspect oriented programming provides some benefits and also there are some costs associated with it. In this thesis we have done a systematic review on aspect oriented software testing in the context of testing challenges. Detailed analysis have been made to show that how effective are the structural test techniques to handle these challenges. We have given the analysis of Aspect-oriented test techniques effectiveness, based on research literature.
