Providing Novel and Useful Data for Game Development Using Usability  	Expert Evaluation and Testing
A case study is done to study whether usability expert evaluation  	and testing are appropriate for game development. In this study,  	it identifies if the usability expert evaluation and testing provide  	novel and useful data for game development. For this experiment,  	a computer game is first evaluated and then tested. Then game developers  	are asked to rate the findings and give other feedback about the  	methods used and the results gained. The usability expert evaluation  	and testing have considerable face validity in game development because  	the results of a case study were both novel and useful for game development.
