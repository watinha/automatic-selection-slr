Creating an Emotionally Adaptive Game
To optimize a players experience, an emotionally adaptive game continuously
adapts its mechanics to the players emotional state, measured in
terms of emotion-data. This paper presents the first of two studies
that aim to realize an emotionally adaptive game. It investigates
the relations between game mechanics, a players emotional state
and his/her emotion-data. In an experiment, one game mechanic (speed)
was manipulated. Emotional state was self-reported in terms of valence,
arousal and boredom-frustration-enjoyment. In addition, a number
of (mainly physiology-based) emotion-data features were measured.
Correlations were found between the valence/arousal reports and the
emotion-data features. In addition, seven emotion-data features were
found to distinguish between a boring, frustrating and enjoying game
mode. Taken together, these features convey sufficient data to create
a first version of an emotionally adaptive game.
