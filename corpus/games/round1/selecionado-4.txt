Challenges in Requirements Engineering for Mobile Games Development:  	The Meantime Case Study
The development of new market-driven software products involves several  	challenges for the requirements engineering process. The challenges  	are deeper in the case these products are mobile video games. In  	particular, the mobile games must satisfy a number of critical non-functional  	requirements (e.g. portability, gameplay, emotional issues). In addition  	to that, mobile games are developed for mass market, demanding from  	the development team to understand the requirements of very diverse  	and sometimes unknown groups of stakeholders. This paper presents  	the experience of meantime, a global mobile game developing company,  	in conducting requirements engineering activities during the development  	of the Frogman game. It also presents some lessons learned in the  	process.
