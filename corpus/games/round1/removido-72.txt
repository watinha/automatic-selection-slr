Digital storytelling and computer game design
This workshop uses a combination of short lecture and hands on practice
to introduce digital storytelling and computer game design and the
multitude of skills needed to successfully design digital stories
and computer games. Working examples are taken from two current projects
at Indiana University: Lost Highways and Rock-Paper-Scissors in Lizard
Land.
