Simulation as a game design tool
In this paper we suggest using gameplay simulations on a logical event
level as a design tool already in the early stages of the development
process. The approach is centred on abstracting all unnecessary details
of the gameplay to produce a highly simplified model of the game
system. Compared to other kinds of intermediate design representations,
such as sketches and prototypes, the simulations can reveal problems
and opportunities in the longer term dynamics of possible gameplay.
As an example we describe an implementation of a simulation model
for the game Tower Bloxx using a simulation software package called
DisCo.
