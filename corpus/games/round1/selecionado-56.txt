Game Usability Heuristics (PLAY) for Evaluating and Designing Better
Games: The Next Iteration
Game developers have begun applying formal human-computer interaction
(HCI) principles in design. Desurvire et al [2] adapted a set of
Heuristics for productivity software to games. The resulting set,
presented at CHI 2004, was Heuristics to Evaluate Playability (HEP).
Generalization of these heuristics is required to make them applicable
to a multiple of game genres and game deliveries. This follow-up
study focused on the refined list, Heuristics of Playability (PLAY),
that can be applied earlier in game development as well as aiding
developers between formal usability/playability research during the
development cycle. Heuristics were formed based on their efficacious
scores on the popular game review website, metacritic.com. Fifty-four
gamers rated High and Low ranked games on 116 potential heuristics.
Implications for how these Heuristics will help developers improve
game quality are discussed. PLAY has been found useful in design
evaluation and elf-report survey format.
