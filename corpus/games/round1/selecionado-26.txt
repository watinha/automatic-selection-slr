Requirements engineering and the creative process in the video game
industry
The software engineering process in video game development is not
clearly understood, hindering the development of reliable practices
and processes for this field. An investigation of factors leading
to success or failure in video game development suggests that many
failures can be traced to problems with the transition from preproduction
to production. Three examples, drawn from real video games, illustrate
specific problems: 1) how to transform documentation from its preproduction
form to a form that can be used as a basis for production;, 2) how
to identify implied information in preproduction documents; and 3)
how to apply domain knowledge without hindering the creative process.
We identify 3 levels of implication and show that there is a strong
correlation between experience and the ability to identify issues
at each level. The accumulated evidence clearly identifies the need
to extend traditional requirements engineering techniques to support
the creative process in video game development.
