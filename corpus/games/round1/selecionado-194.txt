Computer game-flow design
Computer games are a rapidly growing segment of the entertainment
industry. Design and development of modern computer games can be
a complex activity involving many participants from a variety of
disciplines. However, computer game design approaches typically appear
to be less formalised than those used for other types of software
systems. In this article we describe an approach to computer game-flow
design intended for the design of individual game levels within a
computer game and demonstrate its application in practice.
