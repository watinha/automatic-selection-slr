Experimental study of an online game over wireless networks
Online games usually require the delivery of realtime multimedia contents  	over networks. While online games have become increasingly popular  	over the Internet, it is still challenging to build online games  	over wireless networks, where link quality changes from time to time  	and link capacity is usually much smaller compared to wired networks.  	Packet losses and large delay of wireless networks may make online  	gaming an unpleasant experience, especially when a large amount of  	multimedia traffic is exchanged between players. In this paper, we  	implement a two-player competitive online game over wireless LAN  	and test its performance. To reduce the impact of message delay,  	we introduce a design pattern to deduce the traffic of multimedia  	contents by coding game context at the application layer instead  	of transmitting actual multimedia data. Experimental results demonstrate  	that even with a high bit error rate, the application-layer quality  	deterioration is negligible for most game players.
