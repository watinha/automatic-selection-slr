A Semantic Navigation Model for Video Games
Navigational performance of artificial intelligence (AI) characters
in computer games is gaining an increasingly important role in the
perception of their behavior. While recent games successfully solve
some complex navigation problems, there is little known or documented
on the underlying approaches, often resembling a primitive conglomerate
of ad-hoc algorithms for specific situations. In this paper we develop
a generic navigation model which we call semantics-based, because
it enables AI to incorporate a wide variety of navigation information
into the planning of a character's behavior, including raw geometry,
strategic objects, and locomotion abilities. The role of semantics
in this domain is highlighted and the presentation of the main components
of this semantic navigation model is illustrated with a variety of
examples. The semantic navigation model has been validated and implemented
within a navigation system for Unreal Engine 3 that requires little
level designer intervention, has a rich interface for AI programmers,
and can be extended with other types of semantic information. It
is concluded that using this navigation model delivers more natural
paths, requires fewer world annotation, and supports dynamic re-planning.
