Declarative processing for computer games
Most game developers think of databases as nothing more than a persistence  	solution. However, database research is concerned with the wider  	problem of declarative processing. In this paper we demonstrate how  	declarative processing can be applied to computer games. We introduce  	the state-effect pattern, a design pattern that allows game developers  	to design parts of their game declaratively. We present SGL, a special  	scripting language which supports this design pattern and which can  	be compiled to a declarative language like SQL. We show how database  	techniques can process this design pattern in a way that improves  	performance by an order of magnitude or more. Finally, we discuss  	some design decisions that developers must make in order to adopt  	this pattern effectively.
