Detecting clones in game-playing software
The number of competitions using software agents in the AI or entertainment
computing fields has grown over the years from a few to many. For
instance, tournaments exist to let programs to play chess, checker,
go, bridge, poker, simulated soccer, etc. While most competitions
are organized for research purposes, some have a commercial side,
thus raising the stakes for the software authors. Hence, plagiarism
is becoming a problematic issue in the field of game-playing software
agents used in competitions and tournaments. As new ideas and technologies
are successfully implemented in open source programs, they will be
reused and revisited by later programs until they become standard
practices, but on the other hand the same phenomenon can lead to
accusations and claims of plagiarism, especially in competitive scenarios,
such as computer chess tournaments. Establishing whether a program
is a clone or derivative of another can be a difficult and subjective
task, left to the judgment of the individual expert and often resulting
in a shade of gray rather than black and white verdicts. Tournaments
judges and directors have to decide how similar is too similar on
a case-by-case basis. This paper presents an objective framework
under which similarities between game programs can be judged, using
chess as a test case.
