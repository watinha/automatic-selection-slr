Component Based Game Development A Solution to Escalating Costs
and Expanding Deadlines?
Expanding deadlines and escalating costs have notoriously plagued
the game industry. Although the majority of the game development
costs are spent on art and animation, significant cost reductions
and more importantly reductions in development time can be achieved
when developers use off the shelf components rather than develop
them from scratch. However, many game developers struggle with component
integration and managing the complexity of their architectures. This
paper gives an overview of developing games with components, presents
a reference architecture that outlines the relevant areas of reuse
and signifies some of the problems with developing components unique
to the domain of games.
