Challenges in collaborative game design developing learning environments  	for creating games
We perform a general analysis of the game design process, the structure  	of digital games and investigate the requirements for the use of  	OpenCroquet as a platform for collaborative game design. Based on  	our experiences of using a Squeak/Tweak programming environment in  	many game projects and recently for teaching game design we derive  	properties of a learning environment for teaching game design in  	an OpenCroquet environment with a special focus on collaboration.
