Playing online games against computer- vs. human-controlled opponents:
Effects on presence, flow, and enjoyment
The purpose of this study was to examine whether playing online games
against other users leads to different experiences in comparison
with playing against computer-controlled opponents. Thereby, a one-factorial
multivariate design was used (computer-controlled vs. human-controlled
opponent). Dependent variables were the participants feelings of
presence and flow. Additionally, the amount of enjoyment was measured.
The findings indicate that the type of opponent influences playing
experiences: participants who played against a human-controlled opponent
reported more experiences of presence, flow, and enjoyment, whereby
the strongest effect refers to the experience of presence. Furthermore,
strong relations between presence, flow, and enjoyment were observed.
Further analyzes suggest that flow mediates the relationship between
presence and enjoyment.
