Video game values: Human computer interaction and games
Current human computer interaction (HCI) research into video games
rarely considers how they are different from other forms of software.
This leads to research that, while useful concerning standard issues
of interface design, does not address the nature of video games as
games specifically. Unlike most software, video games are not made
to support external, user-defined tasks, but instead define their
own activities for players to engage in. We argue that video games
contain systems of values which players perceive and adopt, and which
shape the play of the game. A focus on video game values promotes
a holistic view of video games as software, media, and as games specifically,
which leads to a genuine video game HCI.
