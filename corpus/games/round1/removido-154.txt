A 3-D computer game controller: design and applications
During the past few decades from the invention of first gaming systems,
there have been only a few designs for 3-D game controllers, most
of which were released in limited numbers due to their high cost.
These controllers were as a result targeted towards virtual reality
applications and have less been used for home gaming applications.
Ultrasonic ranging [Logitech 1992] and image processing techniques
[Marks 2000] are among the methods used to track the position of
the handheld compartment (HC) of the controller. Both of these methods
impose some requirements on the environment in which they are utilized
in, to have the desired performance. Highly reflective surfaces or
materials in the vicinity of the transceivers cause unwanted echoes
in the received signal which degrades the performance of ultrasonic
ranging methods. Image processing techniques require high processing
power and some sort of distinction, usually in color, between the
background and the HC. Additionally, both of these methods fall short
in tracking fast motions of the controller, which further limits
their application. In this work, a novel design for a 3-D computer
game controller using Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) sensors
is presented. The proposed design is virtually independent of the
environment in which it is used and requires small processing power.
