On frame rate and player performance in first person shooter game
The rate at which frames are rendered in a computer game directly  	impact player performance, influencing both the playability and enjoyability.  	However, despite the importance of frame rate and the wide-spread  	popularity of computer games, to the best of our knowledge, there  	is little quantitative understanding of the effects of frame rate  	on the player performance in computer games. This paper provides  	a unique classification of actions in First Person Shooter (FPS)  	games based on interaction requirements that provide a means to qualitatively  	assess the impact of frame rates on player performance. This qualitative  	assessment is supported by quantitative analysis from two large user  	studies that measure the effects of frame rate on the fundamental  	player actions in a First Person Shooter game. Nearly 100 users participated  	in the two user study experiments, providing performance and perception  	data over a range of frame rates commonly studied for video streaming  	and inclusive of frame rates found in many computer game platforms.  	In general, the analysis shows that actions that require precise,  	rapid response, such as shooting, are greatly impacted by degradations  	in frame rates, while actions with lower precision and response requirements,  	such as moving, are more tolerant of low frame rates. These insights  	into the effects of frame rates on player performance can guide players  	in their choice for game settings and new hardware purchases, and  	inform system designers in their development of new hardware.
