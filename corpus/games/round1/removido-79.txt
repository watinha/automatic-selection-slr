Latency and User Behaviour on a Multiplayer Game Server
Multiplayer online games represent one of the most popular forms of
networked group communication on the Internet today. We have been
running a server for a first-person shooter game, Half-Life. In this
paper we analyse some of the delay characteristics of different players
on the server and present some interim results. We find that whilst
network delay has some effect on players behaviour, this is outweighed
by application-level or exogenous effects. Players seem to be remarkably
tolerant of network conditions, and absolute delay bounds appear
to be less important than the relative delay between players.
