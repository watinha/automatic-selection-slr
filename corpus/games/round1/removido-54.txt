The Delta3D Open Source Game Engine
What is it that all game engines and visual simulation tools have
in common? A lot, as it turns out. In fact, game engines have so
much in common that you have to wonder if they should actually be
a commodity and they should be. That advanced feature that makes
one game engine different from all the rest is part of the reason
why game engines and visual simulation tools cost so much. Furthermore,
most game engines have a unique development pipeline associated with
them. The way content is developed and integrated is specific to
that engine, implying limited (if any) portability and reuse. This
business model is perfectly appropriate for the entertainment industry
where having the latest graphics features can make or break a title,
but to the training community, the model simply does not work. We
need to think differently....
