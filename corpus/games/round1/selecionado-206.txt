Better scripts, better games Included
Smarter, more powerful scripting languages will improve game performance
while making gameplay development more efficient. The video game
industry earned $8.85 billion in revenue in 2007, almost as much
as movies made at the box office. Much of this revenue was generated
by blockbuster titles created by large groups of people. Though large
development teams are not unheard of in the software industry, game
studios tend to have unique collections of developers. Software engineers
make up a relatively small portion of the game development team,
while the majority of the team consists of content creators such
as artists, musicians, and designers.
