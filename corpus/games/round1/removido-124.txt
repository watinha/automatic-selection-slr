Critical skills for game developers: an analysis of skills sought  	by industry
With electronic gaming on the rise, several major universities involved  	in game development research have implemented curricula specifically  	for future game developers. Gaming curricula are now being offered  	in smaller universities, colleges, and other educational institutions,  	with other departments wondering if they should follow suit and what  	content should be covered. For this quantitative research, the author  	performed a content analysis on posted job advertisements for game  	developer    	positions, to determine qualities the gaming industry desires when  	seeking game developer employees,. A categorization of qualities  	was performed after reviewing each job ad and five categories for  	qualifications were developed: Experience, Education, Interpersonal  	& Personal Abilities, Technical Skills, and Supporting Knowledge  	and a frequency distribution of the qualities in each ad was performed.  	The results show that there are education and experience levels,  	skills, abilities, and knowledge    	that are clearly sought by industry and certain qualities are sought  	with more frequency than others.
