Aspect-oriented procedural content engineering for game design
Generally progressive procedural content in the context of 3D scene
rendering is expressed as recursive functions where a finer level
of detail gets computed on demand. Typical examples of content procedurally
generated are fractal images and noise textures. Unfortunately, not
always the content can be expressed in this way, developers and content
creators need the data to have some peculiarity (like windows on
a wall for a house 3D model) and a method to drive data simplification
without losing relevant details. In this paper we discuss how aspect
oriented (AO) techniques can be used to drive the content creation
process by mapping each data peculiarity to the code to generate
it. Using aspects will let us to partially evaluate the code of the
procedure improving the performance without losing the flow of the
generation logic. We will also discuss how the use of AO can provide
techniques to build simplified version of the data through code transformations.
