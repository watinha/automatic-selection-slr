A modular parametric architecture for the TORCS racing engine
This paper presents our approach to TORCS Car Racing Competition 2009,
it is based on a complete modular architecture capable of driving
automatically a car along a track with or without oppents. The architecture
is composed of five simple modules being each one responsible for
a basic aspect of car driving. The modules control gear shiftings,
steer movements and pedals positions by using of simple functions
meanwhile the allowed speed in a certain track segment is managed
by a simple TSK fuzzy system.
