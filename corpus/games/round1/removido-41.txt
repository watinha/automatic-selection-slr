Using Data Mining for Dynamic Level Design in Games
Fun is the most important determinant of whether a game will be
successful. Fun can come from challenges and goals, such as victory
in a scenario, the accumulation of money, or the right to move to
the next level. A game that provides a satisfying level of challenge
is said to be balanced. Some researchers use artificial intelligence
(AI) on the dynamic game balancing. They use reinforcement learning
and focuses on the non-player characters. However, this is not suitable
for all game genres such as a game requiring dynamic terrains. We
propose to adjust the difficulty of a game level by mining and applying
data about the sequential patterns of past player behavior. We compare
the performance of the proposed approach on a maze game against approaches
using other types of game AI. Positive feedback and these comparisons
show that the proposed approach makes the game both more interesting
and more balanced.
