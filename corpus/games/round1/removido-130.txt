Sensorium games: usability considerations for pervasive gaming
The Sensorium family of games provides a platform and environment  	for multiplayer games in a pervasive environment. Each player is  	equipped with a mote, which (along with those of other players) is  	an element in a wireless sensor network. Sensorium games are pervasive  	in the truest sense: that is, sensory events in the environment trigger  	events in the game. For example, walking under a light may cause  	a loss of game lives.In this paper, we describe the Sensorium game  	platform and Trove, an implemented game which is a member of the  	Sensorium family. We describe our experiences of player Trove and  	heuristic evaluations of its usability.
