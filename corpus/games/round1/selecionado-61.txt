Non-visual Gameplay: Making Board Games Easy and Fun
In this paper we report the results of a study on an evaluation of
a game and techniques which allow playing board games in the total
absence of visual feedback. We have demonstrated that a camera mouse
can be used for blind navigation within a game field. Snapping a
position of the virtual pointer to the regions of interest as well
as audio-haptic complementary mapping significantly reduce the cognitive
load and facilitate mental matching and integration of overview sound
sequences.
