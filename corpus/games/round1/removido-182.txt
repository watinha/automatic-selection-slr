Enhancing the Performance of Dynamic Scripting in Computer Games
Unsupervised online learning in commercial computer games allows computer-controlled
opponents to adapt to the way the game is being played. As such it
provides a mechanism to deal with weaknesses in the game AI and to
respond to changes in human player tactics. In prior work we designed
a novel technique called ldquodynamic scriptingrdquo that is able
to create successful adaptive opponents. However, experimental evaluations
indicated that, occasionally, the time needed for dynamic scripting
to generate effective opponents becomes unacceptably long. We investigated
two different countermeasures against these long adaptation times
(which we call ldquooutliersrdquo), namely a better balance between
rewards and penalties, and a history-fallback mechanism. Experimental
results indicate that a combination of these two countermeasures
is able to reduce the number of outliers significantly. We therefore
conclude that the performance of dynamic scripting is enhanced by
these counter-measures.
