Multi-platform Online Game Design and Architecture
Contemporary Multi-player online games (MOGs) support only a single
game platform. Our research goal is to provide an MOG service to
users from different platforms. This paper presents the architecture
of the world-wide first multi-platform online game, which consists
of 3D game engines and a multi-platform game server. The experimental
results through the prototype implementation show the feasibility
of simultaneously supporting multiple game platforms.
