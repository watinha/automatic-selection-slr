Go with the flow or seize control? interaction principles that make
games enjoyable
A series of design principles relevant to creating graphics for games
interfaces were interpreted from the work of leading interaction
experts. Students studying for an MSc in Computer Games Graphics
were asked to explore how the principles might improve enjoyment
of a game. The graduates of the course consider visual themes and
their layout; they were asked to develop graphical designs to test
ideas and evaluate them within the group. The purpose of the activity
was to consider how

emotional responses might be improved, during game play, beyond levels
of satisfaction usually asociated with usability.
