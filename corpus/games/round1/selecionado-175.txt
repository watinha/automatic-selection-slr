Free and open source development practices in the game community
The free and open source software (FOSS) approach lets community of
like-minded participants develop software systems and related artifacts
that are shared freely instead of offered as closed-source commercial
products. Free (as in freedom) software and open source are closely
related but slightly different approaches and licensing schemes for
developing publicly shared software. FOSS development communities
don't seem to adopt modern software engineering processes. FOSS communities
develop software that's extremely valuable, generally reliable, globally
distributed, made available for acquisition at little or no cost,
and readily used in its community. Free and open source software
development practices gives rise to new view of how complex software
systems can be constructed, deployed, and evolved. They rely on lean
electronic communication media, virtual project management, and version
management mechanisms to coordinate globally dispersed development
efforts. These FOSS processes offer new directions for developing
complex software systems. We look at the FOSS computer game community
to provide examples of common development processes and practices.
