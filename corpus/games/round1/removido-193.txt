Using Games in Software Engineering Education to Teach Risk Management
An innovative board game was developed at Carnegie Mellon University's  	Master in Software Engineering Program to teach risk management concepts.  	Piloted in two separate courses dealing with software project risk  	management, the goal of the game was to enhance practical learning  	and decision making through simulating a software development project.  	This activity was then compared to others used in the class, specifically  	lectures and case discussions, to assess its effectiveness in meeting  	learning objectives. The results clearly demonstrate the advantages  	of using a game method in teaching software engineering concepts.  	Findings will discuss how the game compares to other teaching activities  	in the classroom in terms of conveying relevant information, help  	in concept understanding and learning enjoyment.
