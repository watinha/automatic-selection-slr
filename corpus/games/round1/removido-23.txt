Software Architecture in Game Development
Summary form only given. Video games have now existed in various forms
for over 30 years, and have evolved from humble beginnings into remarkably
complex software projects. The ever present emphasis on an immersive
audio/visual experience has put game developers in the position of
being on the bleeding edge of exploring the performance of modern
consumer hardware. This talk will discuss the elements that make
up a contemporary video game, the software processes that are involved
in development, key challenges, and look at some important design
patterns that form the architectural basis.
