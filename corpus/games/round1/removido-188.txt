Open-Source Game Development with the Multi-user Publishing Environment  	(MUPE) Application Platform
The Multi-User Application Platform (MUPE) is a platform for rapid  	development of mobile multi-user context-aware applications. MUPE  	server implements a persistent user-authenticated service that can  	be customized into a game server. The game logic is written to the  	MUPE server and the end-users download the game User Interface (UI)  	to their terminals. This paper studies how MUPE can be used to create  	mobile multi-player games. This paper analyzes the important aspects  	of MUPE in game development and the different parts involved in developing  	games with MUPE. Two games made with MUPE are introduced and analyzed.  	The games presented in this paper and the MUPE system are available  	at the MUPE website http://www.mupe.net under the Nokia open source  	license version 1.0a.
