Experience-based design of behaviors in videogames
Artificial intelligence in games is usually used for creating player s
opponents. Manual edition of intelligent behaviors for Non-Player
Characters (NPC) of games is a cumbersome task that needs experienced
designers. Amongst other activities, they design new behaviors in
terms of perception and actuation over the environment. Behaviors
typically use recurring patterns, so that experience and reuse are
crucial aspects for behavior design. In this paper we present a behavior
editor (eCo) using Case Based Reasoning to retrieve and reuse stored
behaviors represented as hierarchical state machines. In this paper
we focus on the application of different types of similarity assessment
to retrieve the best behavior to reuse. eCo is configurable for different
domains. We present our experience within a soccer simulation environment
(SoccerBots) to design the behaviors of the automatic soccer players.
