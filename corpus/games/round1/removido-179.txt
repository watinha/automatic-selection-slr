Dynamic programming and board games: A survey
In several of the earliest papers on dynamic programming (DP), reference
was made to the possibility that the DP approach might be used to
advise players on the optimal strategy for board games such as chess.
Since these papers in the 1950s, there have been many attempts to
develop such strategies, drawing on ideas from DP and other branches
of mathematics. This paper presents a survey of those where a dynamic
programming approach has been useful, or where such a formulation
of the problem will allow further insight into the optimal mode of
play.
