Towards Emotional Characters in Computer Games
This paper describes our research on integrating emotion aspects into
characters of video games. Motivation for this is the significant
absence of emotive expression in most characters of current games.
In order to provide players with a more immersed game experience,
it is essential that characters show compelling expressions, in particular,
facial expressions. As a research methodology, we took several intense
scenes from classic movies and evaluated what would be necessary
to allow a virtual character to reenact the scenes inside a game.
The recreated scenes should convey the same emotions as the original
scenes. Our approach represents the internal state of a video game
characters by using a PAD-based model, as well as modeling the impact
on it of many relevant environment aspects. Representing this internal
state also involves blending together animations to create lively
facial expressions. We conclude that the resulting model is good
enough to allow scenes to be recreated with an emotional load similar
to the original scenes. The approach is also successful inimproving
the consistency of the mood of the characters based on their personality.
