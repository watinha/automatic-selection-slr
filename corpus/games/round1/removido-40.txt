Micro Robot Hockey Simulator - Game Engine Design
Like robot soccer, robot hockey is a game played between two teams
of robots. A robot hockey simulator has been created, for the purpose
of game strategy testing and result visualization. One major modification
in robot hockey is the addition of a puck-shooting mechanism to each
robot. As a result, the mechanics of interaction between the robots
and the hockey puck become a key design issue. This paper describes
the simulator design considerations for robotic hockey games. A potential
field-based strategy planner is implemented which is used to develop
strategies for moving the robots autonomously. The results of the
simulation study show both successful cooperation between robots
(on the strategy level), and realistic interaction between robots
and the puck.
