Managing Projects in a Games Factory: Temporality and Practices
The online gaming world is growing voraciously and so too is the wider
market for computer games which now exceeds the annual global revenues
of cinema. Even so, we have only a limited scholarly understanding
of how games studios produce games. Games projects require particular
attention because their context is unique. We aim to elucidate the
games development process from a time perspective and suggest ways
of managing it. We argue that a games project is characterised by
a compound of temporal rhythms that emanate from the individual,
team, company, industry, nation, inter-nation and marketplace levels.
Project managers need to take account of these 'inner' and 'outer'
temporal rhythms since they can affect development culture and project
chronology.
