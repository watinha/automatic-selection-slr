Large Display Size Enhances User Experience in 3D Games
Large displays are becoming commonplace for home and office computers.
Although researchers have quantified the benefits of working on large
displays, there has been little investigation of how large displays
physiologically and emotionally impact the user. Using subjective
and physiological measures, we compared the users experience when
game playing on a large display versus a small display. We found
that the large display caused greater physiological responses and
higher subjective ratings of excitement. These physiological results
were mirrored in the participants subjective reports. The study
contributes to understanding of interaction with large displays and
refining the requirements for what constitutes effective and desirable
humancomputer interaction (HCI).
