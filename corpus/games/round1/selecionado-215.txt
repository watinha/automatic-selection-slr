Player Modeling Impact on Players Entertainment in Computer Games
In this paper we introduce an effective mechanism for obtaining computer  	games of high interest (i.e. satisfaction for the player). The proposed  	approach is based on the interaction of a player modeling tool and  	a successful on-line learning mechanism from the authors previous  	work on prey/predator computer games. The methodology demonstrates  	high adaptability into dynamical playing strategies as well as reliability  	and justifiability to the game user.
