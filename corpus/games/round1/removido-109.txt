Adaptive server selection for large scale interactive online games
Large scale interactive online games aim to support a very large number
of game players simultaneously. To support hundreds of thousands
of concurrent players, game providers have so far focused on developing
highly scalable game server architectures and extensible network
infrastructures. Recently, distributed online games are beginning
to incorporate more interactive features and action sequences; thus,
it becomes increasingly important to provision server resources in
an efficient manner to support real-time interaction between the
users. In this paper, we present a novel distributed algorithm to
select game servers for a group of clients participating in a large
scale interactive online game session. The goal of server selection
is to minimize the server resource usage while satisfying a real-time
delay constraint. We develop a synchronization delay model for interactive
games and formulate the server selection problem, and prove that
the considered problem is NP-hard. The proposed algorithm, called
zoom-in zoom-out, is adaptive to session dynamics (e.g., clients
join) and lets the clients select appropriate servers in a distributed
manner such that the server resource is efficiently utilized. Using
simulation, we study the performance of the proposed algorithm and
show that it is simple, yet effective in achieving its design goal.
In particular, we show that the performance of our algorithm is comparable
to, or sometimes even better than, that of centralized greedy algorithms,
which require global information and extensive computations.
