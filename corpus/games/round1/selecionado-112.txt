An Empirical Model of the Game Software Development Processes
One of the hottest and fastest developing areas of computer software
in Korea is computer game software. However, due to relatively young
history and empirical nature of the area, there has not been any
agreement or standardization of game software process design for
its efficacy. In this paper, we propose a practical model of the
game software development processes, which can be easily applicable
to the traditional software development based on ISO12207 and/or
RUP through the panel interview of game developers. We evaluate the
model by on-line survey of another set of practical game developers
and break down the results by game platform and game genre. And the
results are quite promising.
