Establishing user requirements: incorporating gamer preferences into
interactive games design
In a previous paper we investigated how various aspects of rally/racing
game design can be quantified for the development of future titles.
This paper explores how gamer preferences can be prioritised, analysed,
and incorporated into the design of rally games by structuring information
via a technique known as the Analytic Hierarchy Process, so as to
allow the data to be put to practical effect by games designers.
Combined with other techniques developed by the authors of this paper,
the results can be used for a holistic management of the design and
development process for many categories of interactive video games.
