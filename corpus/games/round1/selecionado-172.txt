Playful vs. serious instruction giving in a 3D game environment
In this paper we introduce two NLG systems that we developed for the
GIVE challenge, which was aimed at the evaluation of natural language
generation (NLG) systems. The Challenge involved automatically generating
instructions for users to carry out a task in a 3D game environment.
One of our systems focused on generating optimally helpful serious
instructions while the other focused on entertainment, providing
more playful instructions. We used the data gathered in the Challenge
both subjective user ratings and objective task performance data
to compare the efficiency and entertainment value of both systems.
We found a clear difference in efficiency, but were unable to prove
that one system was more entertaining than the other. This could
be explained by the fact that the set-up and evaluation methods of
the GIVE Challenge were not aimed at measuring entertainment. Based
on our experiences, we give some suggestions for the set-up of future
installments of the Challenge.
