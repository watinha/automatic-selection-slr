Architecture patterns for mobile games product lines
Product line software engineering (PLSE) is a promising method for  	software reuse. For the key of success, a reusable and adaptable  	architecture design is necessary. In domain of mobile games product  	lines, architectures have some common structures because of circumstance  	properties of the domain and business constraints. In this paper,  	we classify them as architecture patterns. By doing this, we can  	expect increasing portability, reusability, adaptability, maintainability,  	and eventually productivity and improving quality.
