Collaboration in serious game development: a case study
This paper presents an ethnographic study of the development practices
at a small but successful company that develops serious games for
industry training. We concentrated on the day-to-day collaboration
of the studio team responsible for the game content and software,
and used qualitative research methods, including field observations,
contextual interviews and conversation analysis. This paper reports
our findings, emphasizing a holistic perspective encompassing social
and technical factors influencing collaboration in serious game development.
In particular, we report on how co-location and a positive social
environment work together with the technical tools and infrastructure
to provide an environment that facilitates full participation of
professionals with differing disciplinary perspectives, and contributes
to iterative development and refinement of the game.
