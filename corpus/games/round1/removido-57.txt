Compositional applications of a game engine
In this paper it is suggested that game engine technologies provide  	the capacity for developing existing modes of artistic presentation  	and dissemination within the realms of sound art and music composition/performance.  	The paper outlines three creative works currently under development  	which are predominantly preoccupied with the use of game engines  	for musical and/or sonic purposes. Each project utilizes the game  	engine Unity 3D used in conjunction with external software for sound  	generation, synthesis or musical analysis. The artistic context and  	motivations of the work are briefly discussed, with the three projects,  	SpiralSet, MagNular, and CollideOscope Score subsequently being described  	and outlined.
