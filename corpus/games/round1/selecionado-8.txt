Evaluation of object-oriented design patterns in game development
The use of object-oriented design patterns in game development is
being evaluated in this paper. Games quick evolution, demands great
flexibility, code reusability and low maintenance costs. Games usually
differentiate between versions, in respect of changes of the same
type (additional animation, terrains etc). Consequently, the application
of design patterns in them can be beneficial regarding maintainability.
In order to investigate the benefits of using design patterns, a
qualitative and a quantitative evaluation of open source projects
is being performed. For the quantitative evaluation, the projects
are being analyzed by reverse engineering techniques and software
metrics are calculated.
