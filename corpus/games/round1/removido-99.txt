Game design strategies for collectivist persuasion
A fundamental feature of serious games is persuasion, an attempt to
influence behaviors, feelings, or thoughts. Much of the existing
research on serious games and, more generally, on persuasive technology
(PT), does not address the important links between persuasion and
culture. It has tended to originate from Western, individualist cultures,
and has focused on how to design for these audiences. In this paper,
we describe the design of one of two versions of a serious game we
developed about quitting smoking titled Smoke? which is targeted
at collectivist players. We show how the design was informed by persuasive
strategies we identified from the cross-cultural psychology literature,
intended for use in games for players of collectivist cultures: HARMONY,
GROUP OPINION, MONITORING, DISESTABLISHING, and TEAM PERFORMANCE.
We then discuss the results of a quantitative investigation of the
effects of both game versions on both individualist and collectivist
players.
