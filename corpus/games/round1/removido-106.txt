Making the case for mobile game development
The term mobile culture reflects a phenomenal role that mobile devices
play in our everyday lives. Accordingly, in the eyes of many current
students, computing technology is associated with their mobile phones
and gadgets instead of larger desktops that are commonly used in
the academic environment. Most of them

carry mobile phones with them at all times, and being able to develop
and immediately run an application on their phone may offer an experience
that is as practical and as close to the real world as it gets. By
using mobile computing and, in particular, mobile game development,
it may be possible to make course material more relevant to students;
this also may show a stronger connection to real-world applications
and technology that surround our students.
