Quantifying game design
There is at present a conspicuous need for formal evaluative methods  	which designers of video and computer games can use in order better  	to understand the elusive factors which lead to good gameplay mechanics.  	This paper presents the results of an empirical study which has been  	used to establish a practical quantitative procedure for analysing  	and comparing certain gameplay characteristics of rally (driving)  	games, and thus of determining objectively characteristics which  	are typical of such games at various levels of quality and type.  	The information offered can be used by games developers as pointers  	to building into their products a superior gameplay which potentially  	makes for better reputations and increased sales.
