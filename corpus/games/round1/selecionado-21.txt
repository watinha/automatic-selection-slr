What makes a good game? Using reviews to inform design
The characteristics that identify a good game are hard to define and  	reproduce, as demonstrated by the catalogues of both successes and  	failures from most games companies. We have started to address this  	by undertaking a grounded theoretical analysis of reviews garnered  	from games, both good and bad, to distil from these common features  	that characterize good and bad games. We have identified that a good  	game is cohesive, varied, has good user interaction and offers some  	form of social interaction. The most important factor to avoid is  	a bad pricing. Successfully achieving some of these good factors  	will also outweigh problems in other areas.
