A Component-Based Framework to Rapidly Prototype Online Chess Games  	for Home Entertainment
To reduce the cost and risk of developing computer games, game developers  	are increasingly adopting software engineering methods to produce  	game engines or middleware. In this paper, we take such an approach  	to develop a software framework for rapidly prototyping online chess  	games. A set of application programming interfaces (APIs) is pre-defined  	to deal with the technical details. Following the provided guidelines,  	any game programmer can use APIs to develop his own games in a time-efficient  	manner, and can connect the game to the platform as an application  	for all online players. To demonstrate how our framework can be used  	to develop a game conveniently and efficiently, we have used it to  	design a well-known Chinese chess game as an example.
