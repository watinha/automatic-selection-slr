Interest management middleware for networked games
In this paper we present an implementation of an interest management
scheme using standard message oriented middleware (MOM) technologies
to provide scalable message dissemination for networked games. The
aim of all interest management schemes is to identify when objects
that inhabit a virtual world should be interacting and to enable
such interaction via message passing while preventing objects that
should not be interacting from exchanging messages. The time taken
by existing interest management schemes to resolve which objects
influence each other may be too large to enable the desired interaction
to occur. Furthermore, existing interest management implementations
tend to be proprietary and are built directly on top of networking
protocols. In this paper we present an approach to interest management
based on the predicted movement of objects. Our approach determines
the frequency of message exchange between objects on the likelihood
that such objects will influence each other in the near future. We
then demonstrate, via implementation and experimentation, how existing
middleware standards provide a suitable platform for the deployment
of our interest management scheme.
