A real-time collision detection algorithm for mobile billiards game
Collision detection is a key technique in game design. However, some
algorithms employed in PC game are not suitable for mobile game because
of the low performance and small screen size in mobile devices. Combining
with the features of the mobile devices, this paper proposes a quick
and feasible collision detection algorithm. This algorithm makes
use of the multi-level collision detection and dynamic multi-resolution
grid subdivision to reduce the computing time for collision detection,
which improves the algorithm performance greatly. In the collision
response phase, this paper adopts the time step binary search algorithm
to ensure both the computing precision and system efficiency. The
mobile billiards game designed for the Bird Company indicates that
this algorithm has good performance and real-time interaction.
