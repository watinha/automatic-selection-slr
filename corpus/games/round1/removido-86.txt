Beneficial Dependencies: Design Principles for Narrative Games
This paper presents the leitmotifs of current research on psychologically
colored interactive narration. Virtual Characters, their stories
and adventures are in focus, and not the story of the user. The concept
of a Capricious Non-Player Character (C-NPC) is introduced as a new
kind of agent appropriate for such stories. A C-NPC expects consideration
and support, even towards its technological limitations. A narrative
educational game is presented that functions as a testbed for the
creation of C-NPCs. An overview of the technology employed for dialogue
management is provided.
