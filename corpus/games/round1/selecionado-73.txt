Usability and Computer Games: Working Group Report
Computer games are intended to be fun to play. While they are also  	interactive systems with sophisticated user interfaces, standard  	concepts of usability do not necessarily apply to games. In this  	workshop, we explored the relationship between usability and fun.  	Our central conclusion was that applying standard usability design  	guidelines, such as those proposed by Nielson [4], may improve or  	reduce the fun of a game, but that for many standard usability guidelines,  	there exist equivalent guidelines addressing fun in games.
