Playing different games on different phones: an empirical study on  	mobile gaming
With the growing popularity of mobile phone gaming, design issues  	with mobile phone games have become more important. Given the complexity  	of designing games for mobile phones, game developers must understand  	how mobile phone users gaming experiences are like when using different  	types of phones. This paper examines users gaming experiences in  	playing three types of games on three different types of phones.  	It is found that users have different preferences when playing different  	games on certain phones. Some games are more suitable to be played  	on mobile phone than others. Easy control and fewer levels of difficulties  	are the two main issues for consideration in designing mobile phone  	games. It is recommended that game designers design specific types  	of games for different mobile phone    	interfaces. Mobile phone manufacturers need to consider gamers requirements  	for the type of games they intend to include in the mobile phone.
