What went wrong? A survey of problems in game development
Despite its growth and profitability, many reports about game projects  	show that their production is not a simple task, but one beset by  	common problems and still distant from having a healthy and synergetic  	work process. The goal of this article is to survey the problems  	in the development process of electronic games, which are mainly  	collected from game postmortems, by exploring their similarities  	and differences to well-known problems in traditional information  	systems.
