Software Engineering Challenges in Game Development
In software engineering (SE), video game development is unique yet
similar to other software endeavors. It is unique in that it combines
the work of teams covering multiple disciplines (art, music, acting,
programming, etc.), and that engaging game play is sought after through
the use of prototypes and iterations. With that, game development
is faced with challenges that can be addressed using traditional
SE practices. The industry needs to adopt sound SE practices for
their distinct needs such as managing multimedia assets and finding
the ldquofunrdquo in game play. The industry must take on the challenges
by evolving SE methods to meet their needs. This work investigates
these challenges and highlights engineering practices to mitigate
these challenges.
