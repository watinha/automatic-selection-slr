Exploring success factors of video game communities in hierarchical
linear modeling: The perspectives of members and leaders
Video games are enjoying fast-growing popularity, becoming a major
component of young people s social lives and leisure activities.
Many players share information and conduct social interactions in
virtual communities (VC). The current study sought to examine the
relationships between members and leaders in such video game communities
using a number of variables to describe the member (i.e., knowledge
sharing, usefulness, enjoyability, off-site interaction, satisfaction,
loyalty, and intention to use) and the leader (i.e., leader involvement).
Based on a sample of 2227 members and 41 leaders in 30 video game
communities, the research demonstrated the use of a two-level hierarchical
linear modeling (HLM) to examine the relationships of VC leaders
and members, appropriately adjusted for a nested structure. The results
indicated that leaders who engage in higher levels of involvement
in VC are more likely to have members who agree with and respond
to the community. Furthermore, member- and leader-level factors were
significantly associated with member satisfaction: knowledge sharing,
usefulness, and enjoyability explained within-VC variance while leader
involvement explained between-VC variance. Finally, member satisfaction
demonstrated positive effects on both member loyalty and intention
to use. The study further discussed the implications of these findings,
offering direction for future research.
