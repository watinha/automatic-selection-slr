Design and evaluation of a tactile memory game for visually impaired  	children
Visually impaired people have a lack of proper user interfaces to  	allow them to easily make use of modern technology. This problem  	may be solved with multimodal user interfaces that should be designed  	taking into account the type and degree of disability. The purpose  	of the study presented in this article was to create usable games  	for visually impaired children making use of low-cost vibro-tactile  	devices in multimodal applications. A tactile memory game using multimodal  	navigation support with high-contrast visual feedback and audio cues  	was implemented. The game was designed to be played with a tactile  	gamepad. Different vibrations were to be remembered instead of sounds  	or embossed pictures that are common in memory games for blind children.  	The usability and playability of the game was tested with a group  	of seven 12 13-year-old visually impaired children. The results showed  	that the game design was successful and a tactile gamepad was usable.  	The game got a positive response from the focus group.
