Opening up to agile game development
In fast-paced business environments like computer games, Agile would
seem to be the appropriate style of software development. However,
our study of three computer game studios revealed that game development
does not deploy Agile methods as such, but rather it shares some
of Agiles practices and values. We were intrigued by how agility
was triggered in game development; triggers undocumented by proponents
of Agile methods. This article distils our findings into guidelines
for nurturing and enhancing agility in creative software organizations.
Game development is both inspirational and unpredictable. A games
features may never be fully known at the outset of a project, but
emerge as the developers continually play-test it. This is because
a commercial game must be fun, entertaining and compelling;10 qualities
that are only really assessable when a game is compiled and played.
Agile methods would suggest that game developers write a test script.
This is perhaps more feasible when building commercial task-oriented
software, but a computer game has an added aesthetic dimension to
it; not just in terms of the look and feel, but the game-play too,
i.e. the rules and level of difficulty of the game. In this respect,
a game also needs to be tested intuitively by the developers; it
may functionally run, but is it fun?
