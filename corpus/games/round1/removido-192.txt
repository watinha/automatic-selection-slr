A game-building environment for research in collaborative design
Collaborative design practices are evolving rapidly today as a result
of improvements in telecommunications and human-computer interfaces.
We present a suite of research tools that we have built in order
to evaluate a particular methodology for design based on a theory
of problem solving from the field of artificial intelligence. These
tools are (a) a formal specification for a class of multimedia games,
(b) a game-building tool called PRIME Designer, and (c) a game engine
that brings games to life. The design of these tools addresses several
issues: (1) support for a common language for the design process,
deriving from state-space search, (2) visual interfaces for collaboration,
(3) specifications for a class of games (called PRIME games) whose
affordances represent a balance between simplicity and richness,
(4) educating students to work in design teams that use advanced
computational services, and (5) assessing the learning and contributions
of each team member. We also report on a focus group study in which
four undergraduate students used the tools. Our experience suggests
that users without a computing background can learn how to employ
state-space trees to organize the design process, and thereby gain
facilities to coordinate their individual contributions to the design
of a game.
