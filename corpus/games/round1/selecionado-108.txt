Design and Implementation of an Online 3D Game Engine
This paper proposes Dream3D, an online 3D game engine. We analyze  	requirements to build MMORPGs together with the techniques to satisfy  	them. And then, the techniques are classified into four categories:  	3D rendering, animation, server, and network techniques. We design  	and implement Dream3D to provide all the required functionalities.  	Related with the technique classification, Dream3D consists of four  	subsystems: rendering engine, animation engine, server engine, and  	network engine. For each of the subsystems, we propose an implementation  	model to satisfy the functionality requirements.
