From Gaming Simulation to Case Method Empirical Study on Business  	Game Development and Evaluation
Both Gaming Simulation and Case Method are traditional and powerful  	tools to carry out educational courses in a business school. However,  	there have been few studies to integrate Gaming Simulation and Case  	Method methodology. This paper presents a new practical approach  	for this purpose. At Graduate School of Systems Management, Tsukuba  	University, we have ten years experiences on the business modeling  	course with BMDL/BMDS (Business Model Description Language/ Business  	Model Development System) ar-chitecture. Base on the experience,  	in this paper, we have developed a new business game: ldquoCase of  	Asahi Super Dryrdquo. The aim of this game is to explore managersrsquo  	decision making strategies in a quantitative business operation domain  	through the successful case of Japanese brewery company. Using the  	developed model, we tried to evaluate the effectiveness for Case  	Method on Gaming Simulation. The experimental results have suggested  	the benefits of the proposed approach.
