Design implications of social interaction in online games
While psychologists analyze network game-playing behavior in terms
of players social interaction and experience, understanding user
behavior is equally important to network researchers, because how
players act determines how well systems, such as MMORPGs, perform.
To gain a better understanding of patterns of player interaction
and their implications for game design, we analyze a 1,356-million-packet
trace of ShenZhou Online, a mid-sized commercial MMORPG. To the best
of our knowledge, this work is the first to put forward architectural
design recommendations for online games based on analysis of player
interaction.

We find that the dispersion of players in a virtual world is heavy-tailed,
which implies that static and fixed-size partitioning of game worlds
is inadequate. Neighbors and teammates tend to be closer to each
other in network topology. This property is an advantage, because
message delivery between the hosts of interacting players can be
faster than between those of unrelated players. In addition, the
property can make game playing fairer, since interacting players
tend to have similar latencies to their servers. We also find that
participants who have a higher degree of social interaction tend
to play much longer, and players who are closer in network topology
tend to team up for longer periods. This suggests that game designers
could increase the stickiness of games by supporting, or even forcing,
team playing.
