Expert review method in game evaluations: comparison of two playability
heuristic sets
The expert review method is not yet widely adopted in game evaluations,
although it has been used successfully in productivity software evaluations
for years. In order to use the method effectively, there need to
be playability heuristics that take into account the characteristics
of the videogames. There are a few playability heuristic sets available,
but they have several differences, and they have not been compared
to discover their strengths and weaknesses in game evaluations. In
this paper, we report on a first study comparing two playability
heuristic sets when evaluating the playability of a videogame. The
results indicate that the heuristics can assist the evaluators in
evaluating both the user interface and the gameplay aspects of the
game. However, playability heuristics need to be developed further
before they can be utilized by the practitioners. Especially, the
clarity and comprehensibility of the heuristics need to be improved,
and the optimal number of heuristics is still open.
