Re-using digital narrative content in interactive games
This paper presents a model, called Scene-Driver, for the re-use of
film and television material. We begin by exploring general issues
surrounding the ways in which content can be sub-divided into meaningful
units for re-use and how criteria might then be applied to the selection
and ordering of these units. We also identify and discuss the different
means by which a user might interact with the content to create novel
and engaging experiences. The Scene-Driver model has been instantiated
using content from an animated children's television series called
Tiny Planets, which is aimed at children of 5 7-year old. This type
of material, being story-based itself, lends itself particularly
well to the application of narrative constraints to scene reordering,
to provide coherence to the experience of interacting with the content.
We propose an interactive narrative-driven game architecture, in
which a user generates novel narratives from existing content by
placing domino like tiles. These tiles act as glue between scenes
and each tile choice dictates certain properties of the next scene
to be shown within a game. There are three different game-types,
based on three different ways in which tiles can be matched to scenes.
We introduce algorithms for generating legal tile-sets for each of
these three game-types, which can be extended to include narrative
constraints. This ensures that all novel orderings adhere to a minimum
narrative plan, which has been identified based on analysis of the
Tiny Planets series and on narrative theories. We also suggest ways
in which basic narratives can be enhanced by the inclusion of directorial
techniques and by the use of more complex plot structures. In our
evaluation studies with children in the target age-range, our game
compared favourably with other games that the children enjoyed playing.
