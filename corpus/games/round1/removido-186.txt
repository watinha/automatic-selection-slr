Generative conversation tool for game writers
Conversation is an important part of many games, whether it is there
to provide information or entertainment. In the current state of
commercial game development, almost all conversation is hand-authored.
Further, different authoring approaches are used for conversations
between non-player characters (typically linear scripting) versus
conversations between a non-player character and a human player (typically
dialogue trees). In this paper, we present a tool, designed in collaboration
with Telltale Games, for creating cocktail party conversations in
which characters engage in free-flowing conversations. From an authorial
perspective, we start at the hand-authoring side of the spectrum
and add system-level support for conversation generation -- our aim
is to decrease the authorial burden of creating a conversation while
remaining close to existing methods the company's designers are familiar
with using.
