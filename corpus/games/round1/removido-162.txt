Prediction-based real-time resource provisioning for massively multiplayer
online games
Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are a class of computationally
intensive client server applications with severe real-time Quality
of Service (QoS) requirements, such as the number of updates per
second each client needs to receive from the servers for a fluent
and realistic experience. To guarantee the QoS requirements, game
providers currently over-provision a large amount of their resources,
which makes the overall efficiency of provisioning and utilization
of resources rather low and prohibits any but the largest providers
from joining the market. To address this deficiency, we propose a
new prediction-based method for dynamic resource provisioning and
scaling of MMOGs in distributed Grid environments. Firstly, a load
prediction service anticipates the future game world entity distribution
from historical trace data using a fast and flexible neural network-based
method. On top of it, we developed generic analytical game load models
used to foresee future hot-spots that congest the game servers and
make the overall environment fragmented and unplayable. Finally,
a resource allocation service performs dynamic load distribution,
balancing, and migration of entities that keep the game servers reasonably
loaded such that the real-time QoS requirements are maintained. Experimental
results based on a realistic simulation environment demonstrate the
advantages of our prediction service compared to other conventional
methods, especially due to its ability to adapt to different user
load patterns, and a reduction of the average over-allocation from
250% (in the case of static over-provisioning) to around 25% using
our dynamic provisioning method.
