Designing Storytelling Games That Encourage Narrative Play
Storytelling games are a form of competitive storytelling framed in
the context of gameplay. However, most existing storytelling games
emphasize competitive gameplay and winning at the expense of competitive
narrative play; they tend to be storytelling games rather than storytelling
games. This paper explores issues related to the design of storytelling
games that are won through narrative play and proposes a number of
design rules for this. These design rules not only help in the design
of storytelling games with a stronger element of narrative play,
they also have implications for the design of computational storytelling
systems.
