The distinctive challenges of pervasive games as distributed real-time
applications
Summary form only given. Pervasive games are an emerging form of distributed
real-time application that extend computer gaming out into the real
world. From the city streets to the remote wilderness, players with
mobile computing devices move through the world, sensors capture
information about their current context, including their location,
and this is used to deliver a gaming experience that adapts to where
they are, what they are doing, and even how they are feeling. Players
becomes unchained from their consoles and experience a game that
is interwoven with the real world and that is potentially available
at any place and any time. Pervasive games raise significant new
challenges for the designers of distributed real-time applications,
many of which arise from the distinctive characteristics of the underlying
fabric of sensing and wireless communications technologies that constitute
the ubiquitous computing infrastructure. Drawing on a series of recent
collaborations with artists to develop, tour and study pervasive
games, the author articulates these distinctive design challenges,
exploring issues such as support for location-based play, revealing
the nature of the ubiquitous infrastructure to designers, and adapting
long-term persistent games with patterns of daily life.
