A type assignment system for game semantics
We present a type assignment system that provides a finitary interpretation
of lambda terms in a game semantics model. Traditionally, type assignment
systems describe the semantic interpretation of terms in domain-theoretic
models. Quite surprisingly, the type assignment system presented
in this paper is very similar to the traditional ones, the main difference
being the omission of the subtyping rules.
