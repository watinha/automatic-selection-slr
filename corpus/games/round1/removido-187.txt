Research on a New Development Framework for Mobile Games
A new development framework for mobile games is proposed. In this  	framework, pressure movement module, module of thread pool based  	on I/O completion port, and message module are explained in detail.  	The proposed framework can solve three main problems caused by traditional  	framework. Firstly, single server may exhaust their resources. Secondly,  	synchronization and exclusion of multi-thread can lead to huge system  	resource consumption. Finally, server can not manage thread resources  	flexibly. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is  	effective.
