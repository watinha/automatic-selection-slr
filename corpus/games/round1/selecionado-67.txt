An architecture to easily produce adventure and movie games for the
mobile scenario
Simple and easy-to-play casual games are flooding the mobile gaming
market and are best-sellers on the mobile game charts of several
cellphone network operators. Most of the titles are mobile versions
of videogames developed in the '80s and '90s, which were also very
simple and easy-to-play. In this article we focus on adventure and
movie games, a genre simple, easy-to-play, and very popular in the
past. We propose a software architecture to easily produce full-motion
adventure games for the mobile scenario, and thus potentially transform
any modern cellphone into an adventure game console. The games are
portable and protected against un-authorized usage. The feasibility
of our approach is shown through a prototype player and an evaluation
that shows the suitability of the proposed approach for the mobile
scenario. The simplicity of our approach along with the ubiquity
of modern cell-phones may bring new life to adventure games, which
can also become an exciting genre for the current mobile gaming scenario.
