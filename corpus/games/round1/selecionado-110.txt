Generation and control of game virtual environment
In this paper, we present a framework for the generation and control
of an Internet-based 3-dimensional game virtual environment that
allows a character to navigate through the environment. Our framework
includes 3-dimensional terrain mesh data processing, a map editor,
scene processing, collision processing, and walkthrough control.
We also define an environment-specific semantic information editor,
which can be applied using specific location obtained from the real
world. Users can insert text information related to the characters
real position in the real world during navigation in the game virtual
environment.
