From Usability to Playability: Introduction to Player-Centred Video
Game Development Process
While video games have traditionally been considered simple entertainment
devices, nowadays they occupy a privileged position in the leisure
and entertainment market, representing the fastest-growing industry
globally. We regard the video game as a special type of interactive
system whose principal aim is to provide the player with fun and
entertainment. In this paper we will analyse how, in Video Games
context, Usability alone is not sufficient to achieve the optimum
Player Experience. It needs broadening and deepening, to embrace
further attributes and properties that identify and describe the
Player Experience. We present our proposed means of defining Playability.
We also introduce the notion of Facets of Playability. Each facet
will allow us to characterize the Playability easily, and associate
them with the different elements of a video game. To guarantee the
optimal Player Experience, Playability needs to be assessed throughout
the entire video game development process, taking a Player-Centred
Video Game Design approach.
