Learning object-oriented design by creating games
Playing computer games is a popular recreational activity for young
people. Creating a state-of-the-art commercial computer game is an
incredibly difficult task. Writing a game like Pac-Man from scratch
in a modern programming language is still difficult. Fortunately,
several currently available tools make game creation easier. These
tools can be used to create more complex games, but they offer only
limited programming possibilities. Many similar packages exist. One
such program is Game Maker, which is a rapid-application development
tool. The Game Maker interface uses an object-oriented, event-driven
approach. With Game Maker's drag-and-drop techniques, users can create
games without writing a single line of code. But the program also
includes an interpreted programming language. The program produces
stand-alone games that can be distributed freely: a version of Game
Maker, itself, is available for free as well.
