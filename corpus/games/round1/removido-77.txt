Measuring player experience on runtime dynamic difficulty scaling
in an RTS game
Do players find it more enjoyable to win, than to play even matches?
We have made a study of what a number of players expressed after
playing against computer opponents of different kinds in an RTS game.
There were two static computer opponents, one that was easily beaten,
and one that was hard to beat, and three dynamic ones that adapted
their strength to that of the player. One of these three latter ones
intentionally drops its performance in the end of the game to make
it easy for the player to win. Our results indicate that the players
found it more enjoyable to play an even game against an opponent
that adapts to the performance of the player, than playing against
an opponent with static difficulty. The results also show that when
the computer player that dropped its performance to let the player
win was the least enjoyable opponent of them all.
