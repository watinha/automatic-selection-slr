Plagiarism detection in game-playing software
Plagiarism is a growing issue in the field of game-playing software.
As new ideas and technologies are successfully implemented in free
and commercial programs, they will be reused and revisited by later
programs until they become standard, but on the other hand the same
phenomenon can lead to accusations and claims of plagiarism, especially
in competitive scenarios such as computer chess tournaments. Establishing
whether a program is a "clone" or derivative of another can be a
difficult and subjective task, left to the judgment of the individual
expert and often resulting in a shade of gray rather than black and
white verdicts. Tournaments judges and directors have to decide how
similar is too similar on a case-by-case basis. This paper presents
an objective framework under which similarities between game programs
can be judged, using chess as a test case.
