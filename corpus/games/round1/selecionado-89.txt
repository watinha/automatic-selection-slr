Investigating the Applicability of Usability and Playability Heuristics  	for Evaluation of Pervasive Games
This paper investigates to what extent traditional methods for usability  	evaluation can reveal problems and issues in pervasive games. The  	questions of importance for the study could be summarized as: what  	kind of problems in pervasive games can usability evaluation methods  	reveal? Which of these problems are general/traditional usability  	problems, which problems can be related to general problems in computer  	games and most importantly: which problems are unique for the genre  	of pervasive games? In order to approach these questions, a pervasive  	game prototype called "SupaFly", have been evaluated with 58 participants  	and by use of three standard usability evaluation methods; qualitative  	questionnaires, system logs and focus group interviews. The problems  	identified in the evaluation are analyzed and compared to categories  	and heuristics of previously known usability problems and problems  	identified in computer games (playability problems) in order to outline  	the problems unique for pervasive games. Of a total number of 16  	issues, six issues were at least partly not covered by traditional  	usability and playability. Of these six issues, three problematic  	issues were completely unique for pervasive games: the connection  	between the platforms of the game (unclear relation between game  	platforms), the role and meaning of player positioning (unclear role  	of player positioning (location)) and the level of social interaction  	(levels of interaction not aligned with social needs).
