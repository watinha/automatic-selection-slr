An Algebraic Account of References in Game Semantics
We study the algebraic structure of a programming language with higher-order
store, in the style of ML references. Instead of working directly
on the operational semantics of the language, we consider its fully
abstract game semantics defined by Abramsky, Honda and McCusker one
decade ago. This alternative description of the language is nice
and conceptual, except on one significant point: the interactive
behavior of the higher-order memory cell is reflected in the model
by a strategy cell whose definition remains slightly enigmatic. The
purpose of our work is precisely to clarify this point, by providing
a neat algebraic definition of the strategy. This conceptual reconstruction
of the memory cell is based on the idea that a general reference
behaves essentially as a linear feedback (or trace operator) in an
ambient category of Conway games and strategies. This analysis leads
to a purely axiomatic proof of soundness of the model, based on a
natural refinement of the replication modality of tensor logic.
