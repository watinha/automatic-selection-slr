Measuring and defining the experience of immersion in games
Despite the word's common usage by gamers and reviewers alike, it
is still not clear what immersion means. This paper explores immersion
further by investigating whether immersion can be defined quantitatively,
describing three experiments in total. The first experiment investigated
participants abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive
task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes
in participants eye movements during an immersive task. The third
experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace
of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety,
positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that
immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as
well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore,
immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions
and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.
