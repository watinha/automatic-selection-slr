Pervasive Game Flow: Understanding player's enjoyment in pervasive  	games
Player enjoyment is perhaps the most important issue in successful  	game design, but so far it has not been addressed in the area of  	pervasive games. Departing from the general gameflow model, this  	article presents an initial outline for a new model of pervasive  	player enjoyment, that is, the pervasive gameflow model, which is  	described and discussed in terms of additions and elaborations to  	the general gameflow model. It is intended to serve as a departure  	point for further empirical studies on player enjoyment in pervasive  	games.
