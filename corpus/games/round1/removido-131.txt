Architectural studies of games engines - The quake series
The move of commercial companies to "open-source" their products presents  	challenges for both the proposing company and the wider open source  	(OS) communities. The former has to align their source code to the  	OS practices, while the latter has to cope with large amounts of  	closely-developed code. This paper aims to present relevant data  	and results from the analysis performed on the Quake family of OSS  	game engines, including findings and an initial interpretation of  	the data. This forms the basis for the architectural understanding  	necessary to design and develop improvements and new features to  	the studied game engines. The presented approach constitutes a useful  	resource for games developers who wish to contribute to the further  	evolution of these games engines; and it provides insights into how  	the Quake engine architecture has evolved in practice since it was  	released as an open source project.
