Playability heuristics for mobile games
Expert evaluation is a widely used method for evaluating the usability  	of software products. When evaluating games, traditional usability  	heuristics lack comprehension and cannot be directly applied. In  	this paper, we introduce playability heuristics that are specifically  	designed for evaluating mobile games. Heuristics form a core model  	that can be used in any mobile game evaluation. The model consists  	of three modules: Game Usability, Mobility, and Gameplay. The mobile  	context has some unique characteristics, which require special attention  	during the evaluation. These characteristics are described in mobility  	heuristics. Mobile devices also set some of their own requirements  	for general usability and these issues are described along with game  	usability heuristics. These heuristics have been developed by using  	an iterative design process of a mobile game. In addition, we have  	validated the heuristics and evaluated five mobile games by using  	them with the expert evaluation method. The results indicate that  	playability problems, which violate game usability or mobility heuristics,  	are quite easy to identify. Gameplay problems are harder to find,  	but gameplay heuristics help in evaluation and focus on different  	aspects of the gameplay.
