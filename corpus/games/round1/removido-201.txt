Evolutions in Gaming
Game consoles are encroaching on PC territory, says Mark Claypool,
associate professor in the computer science department at Wooster
Polytechnic Institute. "Now they have hard drives, main memory, a
programmable processor, a big graphics card, and networking." While
game consoles aren't upgraded as often as PCs are-the last upgrades
were four and five years ago-the most recent upgrades share the common
denominator of "more": more power, better graphics, and more connections
with other players. Last year's releases from the big three in gaming
consoles-Microsoft's Xbox 360, Nintendo's Wii, and Sony's PlayStation
3-represent an evolution in both technology and purpose, expanding
game play and its applications.
