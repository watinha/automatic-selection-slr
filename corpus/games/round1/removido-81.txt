Consumer behavior in online game communities: A motivational factor  	perspective
The concept of online communities has been used to improve customers  	loyalty in recent years. While studies on transaction community such  	as online auction have received more attention in the literature,  	entertainment community such as online game has seldom been addressed.  	This study applies the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and modifies  	the technology acceptance model (TAM) to propose a research model.  	An empirical study involving 356 subjects was conducted to test this  	model. The results indicate that customer loyalty is influenced by  	perceived enjoyment, social norms and preference. Perceived cohesion  	has an indirect impact on loyalty. In addition, the finding s practical  	implication suggests that community managers must overcome the problems  	users encounter, including suffering from an unstable system, malicious  	players and grief players.
