Design facial appearance for roles in video games
Roles in video games often serve as avatars of players. Different
game players may have their particular preferences on a role s facial
appearance. It would be desirable to allow players to customize the
design of roles. This paper presents two methods for recommending
a roles facial appearance for a particular game player and illustrates
the two methods by using heroic roles as an example. The two recommendation
methods are designated as the text-input and the picture-input approaches.
The text-input approach requests the game player to carry out pairwise
comparisons for determining the relative weights of 16 personality
traits of heroes. The recommendation mechanism for the text-input
approach is based on the fuzzy AHP (analytic hierarchy process).
Whereas the picture-input approach requests the game player to view
a sample set of pictures and rate his/her preferences on each picture.
The recommendation mechanism for the picture-input approach is based
on the BP (back-propagation) neural network. Experiments indicated
that the text-input approach is more effective in terms of recommending
an appropriate facial appearance, yet at the expense of needing more
user time.
