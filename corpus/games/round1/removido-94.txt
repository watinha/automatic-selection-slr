The structure of games
Computer Game Playing has been an active area of research since Samuel s
first Checkers player (Samuel 1959). Recently interest beyond the
classic games of Chess and Checkers has led to competitions such
as the General Game Playing competition, in which players have no
beforehand knowledge of the games they are to play, and the Computer
Poker Competition which force players to reason about imperfect information
under conditions of uncertainty. The purpose of this dissertation
is to explore the area of General Game Playing both specifically
and generally. On the specific side, we describe the design and implementation
of our General

Game Playing system OGRE. This system includes an innovative method
for feature extraction that helped it to achieve second and fourth
place in two international General Game Playing competitions. On
the more general side, we also introduce the Regular Game Language,
which goes beyond current works to provide support for both stochastic
and imperfect information games as well as the more traditional games.
