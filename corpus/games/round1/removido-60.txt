Non-visual game design and training in gameplay skill acquisition  	 A puzzle game case study
This paper reports the results of a study on the design and evaluation  	of the game and techniques which allow puzzles to be played in the  	absence of visual feedback. We have demonstrated that a camera-mouse  	can be used successfully for blind navigation and target location  	acquisition within a game field. To gradually teach the players the  	sequential learning method was applied. Blind exploration of the  	gamespace was augmented with sticky labels and overview sound cues,  	verbal and non-verbal, which can significantly reduce the cognitive  	load and facilitate mental matching and integration. The full-sticky  	labels technique does not require fine motor skills and allows a  	user to gain control over the game with a minimum level of skills.  	With the vertical sticky labels technique training was focused on  	the development of accurate head movements only on a horizontal plane.  	With practice, the players can use the non-sticky labels technique.  	After 240 trials (3 4 h), the cumulative experience of the blindfolded  	players was increased 22.5 27 times compared to the initial 10 trials.
