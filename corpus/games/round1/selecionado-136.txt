ISO 9241-9 evaluation of video game controllers
Fifteen participants completed a study comparing video game controllers  	for point-select tasks. We used a Fitts' law task, as per ISO 9241-9,  	using the Nintendo Wii Remote for infrared pointing, the Nintendo  	Classic Controller for analogue stick pointing, and a standard mouse  	as a baseline condition. The mouse had the highest throughput at  	3.78 bps. Both game controllers performed poorly by comparison. The  	Wii Remote throughput was 31.5% lower, at 2.59 bps, and the Classic  	Controller 60.8% lower at 1.48 bps. Comparing just the video game  	controllers, the Wii Remote presents a 75% increase in throughput  	over the Classic Controller . Error rates for the mouse, Classic  	Controller , and the Wii Remote were 3.53%, 6.58%, and 10.2%, respectively.  	Fourteen of 15 participants expressed a preference for the Wii Remote  	over the Classic Controller for pointing tasks in a home entertainment  	environment.
