Head Tracking in First-Person Games: Interaction Using a Web-Camera
Recent advances in face-tracking technology have made it possible
to recognize head movements using a commodity web-camera. This development
has created exciting possibilities for enhancing player enjoyment
during computer game play. In order to ascertain the real-world potential
for head gestural input to First Person Shooter games, we have developed
seven diverse interaction techniques and integrated these with a
modern games engine. Evaluation of the techniques was carried out
with four focus groups made up of expert games developers and experienced
end-users. One of the techniques was further refined and subjected
to a follow-up comparison test with promising results. A set of guidelines
for the future development of head interaction techniques for computer
games has been derived from the studies. All of the techniques have
been built upon freely available software and open-sourced to encourage
further research in this area.
