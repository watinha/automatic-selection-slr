Key factors of heuristic evaluation for game design: Towards massively
multi-player online role-playing game
The computer game industry has become the fastest growing field of
the entertainment industry. However, only a very small number of
computer game products overcome the costs of production and generate
earnings. According to traditional marketing wisdom, customers preferences
must be analyzed correctly to create successful products, and in
the gaming industry, such information must be considered during the
design process. This research aims to explore key factors of heuristic
evaluation for game design. A review of literature pertaining to
computer games and HCI was conducted along with an empirical research
of a Massively Multi-player Online Role-playing Game (MMORPG). We
identified 18 usability issues in MMORPG and presented a recommendation
relevant to the issues. Empirical data were applied to a new heuristic
evaluation framework. We determined the relationship between key
factors and four game categories, such as game interface, game play,
game narrative, and game mechanics. Moreover, the results presented
54 key factors for a new heuristic evaluation framework for game
design. The conclusion presents key implications of our research
in a game design context, particularly related to early design processes.
