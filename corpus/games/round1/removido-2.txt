Reasoning about coalitional games
We develop, investigate, and compare two logic-based knowledge representation  	formalisms for reasoning about coalitional games. The main constructs  	of Coalitional Game Logic (cgl) are expressions for representing  	the ability of coalitions, which may be combined with expressions  	for representing the preferences that agents have over outcomes.  	Modal Coalitional Game Logic (mcgl) is a normal modal logic, in which  	the main construct is a modality for expressing the preferences of  	groups of agents. For both frameworks, we give complete axiomatisations,  	and show how they can be used to characterise solution concepts for  	coalitional games. We show that, while cgl is more expressive than  	mcgl, the former can only be used to reason about coalitional games  	with finitely many outcomes, while mcgl can be used to reason also  	about games with infinitely many outcomes, and is in addition more  	succinct. We characterise the computational complexity of satisfiability  	for cgl, and give a tableaux-based decision procedure.
