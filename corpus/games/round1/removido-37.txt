Dynamic Terrain LOD with Region Preservation in 3D Game Engine
In the outdoor 3D game, the terrain can be modified because of interaction.  	This brings two new complexities to render terrain in 3D game. The  	first lies in the real-time visualization of dynamic terrain, and  	the second is that the modified terrain surface need to be preserved.  	We present an algorithm for dynamic terrain LOD(DT LOD) with preserving  	region in 3D game engine. The algorithm uses a DAG to represent dependency  	relationship of vertices which split triangles, and employs an active  	vertices set to update triangles in two consecutive frames for improving  	rendering performance. The region LOD can be constructed according  	to the view direction and the distance between the viewpoint and  	regions. The results of experiments show that our algorithm has a  	effective performance during rendering terrain.
