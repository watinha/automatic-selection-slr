User-System-Experience Model for User Centered Design in Computer  	Games
This paper details the central ideas to date, from a PhD entitled  	Player Profiling for Adaptive Artificial Intelligence in Computer  	and Video Games. Computer and videogames differ from other web and  	productivity software in that games are much more highly interactive  	and immersive experiences. Whereas usability and user modelling for  	other software may be based on productivity alone, games require  	an additional factor that takes account of the quality of the user  	experience in playing a game. In order to describe that experience  	we describe a model of User, System and Experience (USE) in which  	the primary construct for evaluation of a players experience will  	be the Experience Fluctuation Model (EFM), taken from Flow theory.  	We illustrate with a straightforward example how this system may  	be automated in real-time within a commercial game.
