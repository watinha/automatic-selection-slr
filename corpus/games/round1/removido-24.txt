Measuring Game-Play Performance and Perceived Immersion in a Domed  	Planetarium Projection Environment
Game playing in immersive projection environments such as caves and  	domes is assumed to offer an enhanced experience but there is little  	quantitative research that measures this. This paper reports on a  	study of user performance statistics while playing a computer game  	projected onto a planetarium dome and compares these with similar  	measurements taken in a conventional projected flat screen environment.  	A survey of users subjective impressions of immersion was also taken  	and used to compare these display modes. Analysis of users in each  	mode revealed differences in user experience and some aspects of  	performance. It was confirmed that dome projection enhanced the players  	sense of immersion when compared with flat projection. Navigation  	speed was found to decline in the dome while other performance metrics  	showed no significant difference between the environments.
