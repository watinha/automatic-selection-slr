Player-centred game design
Videogames are not your typical software application. They are often
designed to elicit a negative emotional response, such as frustration
or fear, the antithesis of usability. However, this is not to suggest
that HCI has little to offer the game design community. Indeed, the
exact opposite appears to be true. A number of user-centred design
techniques have evolved which can support each stage of the game
design process, from concept through to post-production. However,
there is currently no archive of appropriate techniques showing how
they might be applied to videogame design. Given the differences
in goals from these products to traditional software, this is clearly
necessary. The purpose of this workshop is to identify those techniques
appropriate to game design, and elicit practitioners' experience
when applying such methodologies. The intended result is a prescriptive
process which demonstrates how user-centred methodologies can best
be applied to game design.
