Toward mobile entertainment: A paradigm for narrative-based audio
only games
The widespread use of sophisticated mobile computing devices has set
the stage for a renaissance in audio only entertainment. Traditional
visual games are already used widely in cellular phones and similar
devices. A significant limitation is the small display size. In contrast,
audio only games on suitable mobile hardware need not degrade due
to the smaller form factor. This makes audio only games an attractive
alternative to visual games. We describe a framework for authoring
interactive narrative-based audio only games set in 3D virtual environments.
Despite the novelty in audio only gaming, our approach builds on
a foundation of several years of research into audio only applications
for sight impaired users, augmented reality systems and human computer
interaction studies. In comparison to attempts to provide a realistic
user interface, we argue a simple interface enhances both immersion
and entertainment value, serendipitously making audio only games
practical for mobile computing. Novel features of our system include
real-time gameplay and multi-player support. We also describe our
software architecture, the current implementation of which uses low-cost
existing PC-based hardware and software. In addition, we describe
our first game, Dragon s Roar.
