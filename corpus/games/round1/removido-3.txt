Information Flow in Concurrent Games
We consider games where the players have perfect information about  	the games state and history, and we focus on the information exchange  	that takes place at each round as the players choose their moves.  	The abilityof a player to gather information on the opponents choice  	of move in a round determines her ability to counteract the move,  	and win the game. When the game is played between teams, rather than  	single players, the amount of intra-team communication determines  	the ability of the team members to coordinate their moves and win  	the game. We consider games with quantitative bounds on inter-team  	and intra-team information flow, and we provide algorithms and complexity  	bounds for their solution.
