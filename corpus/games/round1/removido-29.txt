Computer games: introduction
"Why an issue on computer games?" you may be asking. Several reasons
come to mind. First, computer science owes a lot to computer games.
Obviously, the computer game industry has made significant advances
in computer graphics, but computer games have also made contributions
in other areas such as human computer interaction and computer architecture.
In the future, I believe the contributions from computer games to
computer science, and vice versa, will be even more numerous. Computer
game companies and software and hardware companies are forming alliances
in order to leverage off each other's research. Entertainment companies
and telecommunication companies are also joining these alliances.
Whatever the outcome of these partnerships, we know that computer
games will change dramatically in the future...
