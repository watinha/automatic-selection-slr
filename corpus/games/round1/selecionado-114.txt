Games: Once More, with Feeling
Achieving increased player engagement involves adding deep emotional
experiences to videogames. Games and simulations are already capable
of gripping a player's emotions. From the earliest days of flight
simulators, for example, professional pilots have frequently reported
feeling stressed during simulated emergencies in a training simulator.
Similarly, gamers say that they feel tension during intense moments
in a first-person shooter. Games also seem effective at creating
feelings of triumph and at startling or exciting players.
