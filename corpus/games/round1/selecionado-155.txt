Fun and Games: Multi-Language Development
Computer games (or electronic games if you encompass those games
played on console-class hardware) comprise one of the fastest-growing
application markets in the world. Within the development community
that creates these entertaining marvels, multi-language development
is becoming more commonplace as games become more and more complex.
Today, asking a development team to construct a database-enabled
Web site with the requirement that it be written entirely in C++
would earn scornful looks and rolled eyes, but not long ago the idea
that multiple languages were needed to accomplish a given task was
scoffed at.
