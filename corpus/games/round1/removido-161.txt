A Multi-Core Solver for Parity Games
We describe a parallel algorithm for solving parity games, with applications  	in, e.g., modal u-calculus model checking with arbitrary alternations,  	and (branching) bisimulation checking. The algorithm is based on  	Jurdzinski's Small Progress Measures. Actually, this is a class of  	algorithms, depending on a selection heuristics. Our algorithm operates  	lock-free, and mostly wait-free (except for infrequent termination  	detection), and thus allows maximum parallelism. Additionally, we  	conserve memory by avoiding storage of predecessor edges for the  	parity graph through strictly forward-looking heuristics. We evaluate  	our multi-core implementation's behaviour on parity games obtained  	from u-calculus model checking problems for a set of communication  	protocols, randomly generated problem instances, and parametric problem  	instances from the literature.
