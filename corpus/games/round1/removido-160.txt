A Case Study on Using RTF for Developing Multi-player Online Games
Real-Time Online Interactive Applications (ROIA) include a broad spectrum
of online computer games, as well as challenging distributed e-learning
applications, like virtual classrooms and collaborative environments.
Development of ROIA poses several complex tasks that currently are
addressed at a low level of abstraction. In our previous work, we
presented the Real-Time Framework (RTF) - a novel middleware for
a high-level development and execution of ROIA in single- and multi-server
environments. This paper describes a case study in which a simple
but representative online computer game is developed using RTF. We
explain how RTF supports the design of data structures and their
automatic serialization for network transmission, as well as determining
and processing user actions when computing a new game state; the
challenge is to provide the state updates to all players in real
time at a very high frequency.
