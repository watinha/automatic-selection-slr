A Case Study in Software Product Lines - The Case of the Mobile Game
Domain
Software product lines (SPL) processes are gradually being adopted
by many companies in several domains. A particular domain where the
adoption of such processes may bring relevant benefits is the mobile
applications domain given the big diversity of handsets, although
the characteristics of this domain usually create barriers to apply
these processes in practice, such as, restrictions of memory size
and processing power and different API implementations by different
manufacturers. In this context, this work presents briefly a practical
approach to implement core assets in a SPL applied to the mobile
game domain combining the good practices from the already published
processes and describes in details a case study performed with the
application of this approach, based on three different adventure
mobile games. The results of the case study have shown the approach
can be suitable for the domain in question.
