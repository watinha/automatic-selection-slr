Facilitating collaboration through design games
In recent years both companies and research communities call for collaborative  	work practices and user-centered approaches in various design fields.  	There are several challenges and issues to take into consideration.  	For instance there is a need to find ways of collaborating across  	various competences, interests, responsibilities and perhaps professional  	languages both within one organization, between several organizations  	and between the organizations and a group of (potential) users. It  	is necessary to find ways to learn about users and the contexts of  	use, and to create a common understanding of the development task.  	This paper presents a set of four design games, which offers solutions  	to the challenges mentioned. The design games have been developed  	in the Space Studio during several projects and years. Here experiences  	are discussed on the basis of two research projects carried out in  	collaboration with industrial partners and potential users, and use  	of the games in three educational settings.The overall aim of the  	design games is to help facilitate a user-centered design process  	for cross-disciplinary design groups early in the design process.  	Framing collaborative design activities in a game format, arguably  	improves idea generation and communication between stakeholders.  	By shifting focus to the game, power relations and other factors  	that might hamper idea generation, are downplayed.
