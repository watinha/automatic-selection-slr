Towards Automated Game Design
Game generation systems perform automated, intelligent design of games  	(i.e. videogames, boardgames), reasoning about both the abstract  	rule system of the game and the visual realization of these rules.  	Although, as an instance of the problem of creative design, game  	generation shares some common research themes with other creative  	AI systems such as story and art generators, game generation extends  	such work by having to reason about dynamic, playable artifacts.  	Like AI work on creativity in other domains, work on game generation  	sheds light on the human game design process, offering opportunities  	to make explicit the tacit knowledge involved in game design and  	test game design theories. Finally, game generation enables new game  	genres which are radically customized to specific players or situations;  	notable examples are cell phone games customized for particular users  	and newsgames providing commentary on current events. We describe  	an approach to formalizing game mechanics and generating games using  	those mechanics, using WordNet and ConceptNet to assist in performing  	common-sense reasoning about game verbs and nouns. Finally, we demonstrate  	and describe in detail a prototype that designs micro-games in the  	style of Nintendo s WarioWare series.
