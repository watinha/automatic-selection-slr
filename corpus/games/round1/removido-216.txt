Towards Capturing and Enhancing Entertainment in Computer Games
This paper introduces quantitative measurements/metrics of qualitative  	entertainment features within computer game environments and proposes  	artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for optimizing entertainment  	in such interactive systems. A human-verified metric of interest  	(i.e. player entertainment in real-time) for predator/prey games  	and a neuro-evolution on-line learning (i.e. during play) approach  	have already been reported in the literature to serve this purpose.  	In this paper, an alternative quantitative approach to entertainment  	modeling based on psychological studies in the field of computer  	games is introduced and a comparative study of the two approaches  	is presented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy ANNs are  	used to model player satisfaction (interest) in real-time and investigate  	quantitatively how the qualitative factors of challenge and curiosity  	contribute to human entertainment. We demonstrate that appropriate  	non-extreme levels of challenge and curiosity generate high values  	of entertainment and we discuss the extensibility of the approach  	to other genres of digital entertainment and edutainment.
