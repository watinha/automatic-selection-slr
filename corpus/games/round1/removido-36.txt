Evolution of 3D games on mobile phones
While there is no doubt that there will be an increasing trend towards
3D games on mobile devices the resource constraints of the devices
themselves and the highly variable nature of the environment present
considerable challenges for games developers. In this paper we consider
some of the current constraints together with current and, probable,
future developments both in the software and hardware of mobile phones
that will enable more sophisticated games to be developed. As part
of this process we benchmark some of the latest and most prevalent
software and devices to ascertain both the quality of the graphics
produced and the effects on the battery life. Whilst we are certain
that 3D games play an important future in the success of future mobile
services the current baseline for development is highly variable
and presents difficulties for games programmers both in development
and wide scale distribution.
