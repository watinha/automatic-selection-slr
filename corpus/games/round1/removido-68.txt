Cognitive evaluation of video games: players' perceptions
Video games were evaluated by players very familiar with them, along
five cognitive dimensions drawn from the PASS model. These 233 gamers
evaluated up to three games each which were then placed into genres
defined by GameSpot.com and compared in terms of their perceived
cognitive components. Game genre, for which there was sufficient
number of evaluations, differed along each cognitive dimension.
