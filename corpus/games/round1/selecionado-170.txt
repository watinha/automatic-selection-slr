Designing a narrative-based audio only 3D game engine
Immersing players in believable and engaging virtual environments
is a common goal for many interactive computer games. While PC-based
audio only games set in virtual worlds have traditionally been developed
for blind players, new technology will soon create a market for audio
only games aimed at a mass audience. We propose a framework for authoring
interactive narrative-based audio only adventure games set in 3D
virtual environments. Our work builds on several years of research
into audio only applications for sight impaired users, augmented
reality systems and human-computer interaction studies. We argue
that a simple user interface enhances both immersion and entertainment
value, making audio only games practical for mobile computing. Novel
features of our system include real-time gameplay and support for
multiple players. We also describe a software architecture for creating
audio only games, the current implementation of which uses low-cost
existing PC-based hardware and software.
