Using heuristics to evaluate the playability of games
Heuristics have become an accepted and widely used adjunct method
of usability evaluation in Internet and software development. This
report introduces Heuristic Evaluation for Playability (HEP), a comprehensive
set of heuristics for playability, based on the literature on productivity
and playtesting heuristics that were specifically tailored to evaluate
video, computer, and board games. These heuristics were tested on
an evolving game design to assess their face validity and evaluation
effectiveness compared to more standard user testing methodologies.
The results suggest that HEP identified qualitative similarities
and differences with user testing and that HEP is best suited for
evaluating general issues in the early development phases with a
prototype or mock-up. Combined with user studies, HEP offers a new
method for the HCI game community that can result in a more usable
and playable game.
