Business models and operational issues in the Chinese online game
industry
The rapid growth of Internet usage has enabled many new online communities
to develop. A particularly interesting phenomenon that has arisen
through Internet communities is the virtual world (VW) style of online
game. This paper identifies the challenges that developers of VWs
will face in their efforts to find viable business models. This is
a single case study of China as an exploratory project to determine
the issues surrounding business models for virtual world developers
and users. The paper discusses the feedback effects between broadband
adoption and online games as well as issues such as culture, history,
Waigua, private servers, virtual property trade, developer control,
governance, and regulation. In spite of the profitability of major
Chinese VW operators, close observation of the Chinese case suggests
that even the most successful VW operators are still in the early
stages of their business model development.
