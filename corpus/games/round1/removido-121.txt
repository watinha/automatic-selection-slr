A note on pattern-recognition techniques and game-playing programs
A problem encountered in the design of game-playing programs the evaluation
of board positions is formally identical to a typical pattern-recognition
problem. Certain techniques, which have been found helpful in the
pattern-recognition case, may therefore also be applied to game-playing
programs. A brief review of these techniques, based on multivariate
analysis, is given.
