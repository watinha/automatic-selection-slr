Evolving Games and Essential Nets for Affine Polymorphism
This paper presents a game model of Second-order Intuitionistic Multiplicative  	Affine Logic (IMAL2). We extend Lamarche s essential nets to the  	second-order affine setting and use them to show that the model is  	fully and faithfully complete.
