Making Sense of Stories: the development of a new mobile computer
game
This paper analyzes the retrospective stories of a four person team
responsible for developing a new computer game for mobile phones.
Our theorizing is based on an in-depth, two year, case study. The
research contribution this paper makes is threefold. First, it outlines
and discusses some of the analytical issues at stake in the adoption
of a storytelling approach to understanding IS developments. Second,
we show how individuals' work stories are tools by which they make
sense of organizational events and read meaning into their working
lives and relationships with others. Third, we illustrate the roles
that individuals' work stories play in bolstering their self-esteem
by attributing positive outcomes to the self and negative outcomes
to external forces, and in their strategic presentation of the self
to others. Finally we outline some implications for managing the
mobile game development process
