Requirements in Conflict: Player vs. Designer vs. Cheater
There are significant interactions between video game stakeholder
emotional requirements and security requirements. Counter-intuitively,
some traditional security requirements are not necessarily met by
the game implementation some forms of security breaches are condoned
by the stakeholders (if not actually demanded by them) and the requirements
engineering process must support these contradictions. We present
an overview of security requirements for video games and show how
stakeholder diversity introduces significant complexities to the
requirements negotiation process. Our analysis of certain security
threats, and their emotional motivations, shows that these motivations
form an important element of the emotional requirements and that
significant context is necessary for properly capturing the emotional
requirements related to security. Finally, we show how emotional
requirements can be used to guide security goal development for this
domain and propose the use of in-game justice systems to allow players
to address security violations in realtime.
