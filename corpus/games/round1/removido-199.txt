Defining personas in games using metrics
Game metrical data are increasingly being used to enhance game testing  	and to inform game design. There are different approaches and techniques  	to gather the metrics data; however there seems to be a lack of frameworks  	to read and make sense of it. In this paper, the concept of play-persona  	is applied to game metrics, in the specific case of character-based  	computer games, where the player controls a single protagonist, around  	whom the gameplay and -- story evolves. A case is presented for Hitman:  	Blood Money (IO Interactive, 2007). Player-controlled game characters  	can be deconstructed into a range of components and these expressed  	as monitored game metrics. These metrics can subsequently be utilized  	to discover patterns of play by building play-personas: Modeled representations  	of how players interact with the game. This process can also be useful  	to assist game design, by informing whether the game facilitates  	the specific play patterns implied by theoretical play-personas.
