Evolution of 3D mobile games development
3D computer graphics have been an important feature in games development
since it was first introduced in the early 80s and there is no doubt
that 3D based content is often viewed as more attractive in games
than the more abstract 2D graphics. Many games publishers are keen
to leverage their success in the console market into the mobile phone
platform. However, the resource constraints of mobile phones and
the fragmented nature of the environment present considerable challenges
for games developers. In this paper we consider some of the current
constraints together with current and, probable, future developments
both in the software and hardware of mobile phones. As part of this
process we benchmark some of the latest and most prevalent software
and hardware devices to ascertain both the quality of the graphics
produced and the effects upon battery life. Whilst our test results
highlight that the current market does indeed present challenges,
our research into the future developments highlights the fact we
are approaching greater standardization, which will be an important
factor for the successful development of 3D mobile games.
