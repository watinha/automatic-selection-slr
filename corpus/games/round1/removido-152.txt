Framework for evaluation of networked mobile games
In this position paper we propose an evaluation framework for networked  	mobile gaming, consisting of user, group, communication, and environment  	models. Each of these components acts as a detailed representation  	of real-world characteristics. The combination of these models allows  	a realistic modeling of mobile gaming scenarios. The main contribution  	of our approaches is a new class of mobility models, which are purely  	based on strategies derived from real-world scenarios. This allows  	us to simulate the behavior and the movement of users and groups,  	and the communication aspects, and thus, it facilitates a creation  	of test beds for mobile applications. These simulated users interact,  	e.g. communicate, with each other and are able to move purposeful  	as well as to build groups spontaneously depending on the similarity  	of their goals or individual strategies. The paper presents an analytic  	discussion of the framework, its architecture, and the current state  	of its implementation.
