Massively multiplayer online role-playing games: the past, present,  	and future
Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) are emerging  	in the computer game industry as a very popular genre. These games  	have existed since the late 1990s, but in the last few years the  	market has become increasingly strong. This relatively new genre  	is attracting a widespread audience, bringing together those who  	previously enjoyed both pen and paper and computer role-playing games,  	as well as those who enjoy socializing with other players in a virtual  	environment. Game developers see MMORPGs as a potentially profitable  	business due to its widespread appeal, but the reality is that only  	a small percentage of MMORPGs that are released become a success  	[Kosak 2006]. This article attempts to determine the many aspects  	that make a successful MMORPG; it also attempts to ascertain what  	new and innovative features are expected by the users from the next  	generation of MMORPGs. This is achieved by looking at and discussing  	past literature and surveying the MMORPG community's perception of  	previous and current MMORPGs, as well as their expectations of the  	next generation. An online survey attracted 122 participants to provide  	their perceptions of current and past MMORPGs. This article determines  	and outlines the respondents' preferences in the MMORPG genre, discussing  	what implications these could have on its future. The survey also  	gave insight into the respondents' expectations of the future of  	MMORPGs. We conclude this article with a discussion of aspects of  	current MMORPGs that the participants would like improved, as well  	as new features they would like incorporated into the next generation  	of games.
