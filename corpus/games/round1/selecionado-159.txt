Relating cognitive models of computer games to user evaluations of  	entertainment
As the interactive entertainment industry matures, a better understanding  	of what makes software entertaining is needed. A natural starting  	point is the application of traditional Human-Computer Interaction  	(HCI) tools to interactive entertainment software. HCI tools include  	cognitive models that researchers have used to model users' thought  	processes and evaluate interface design. This paper users a simple  	cognitive model to investigate the relationship between the complexity  	of an interaction and the entertainment experienced by the user.  	We design a simple computer game, create a normative model for how  	a user plays this game, and build several variations of this game  	such that normative models of these variants differed across two  	factors: pace and complexity. User studies conducted on these variations  	allow comparison with these factors to user performance and self-reported  	user enjoyment. Users ingame enjoyment was found to be related to  	both the subject's performance and the game complexity.
