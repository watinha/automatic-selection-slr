A hybrid architecture for massively multiplayer online games
Many massively multiplayer online games use client-server architectures
that have enormous server-side bandwidth requirements. Peer-to-peer
game architectures provide better scaling, but open the game to additional
cheating, since players are responsible for distributing events and
storing state. We have developed a hybrid game architecture that
maintains centralized control of state, while significantly reducing
server bandwidth. The architecture uses a combination of client-server
and peer-to-peer event distribution, so that only critical events
are processed by the server. In addition, the architecture uses measurements
and monitoring to ensure that players are capable of handling event
distribution and are indeed providing this service. By lowering the
bandwidth needed to host a game, while also providing a simple way
to prevent cheating, our hybrid architecture allows game companies
to support more concurrent players while still providing a controlled
game experience. We deploy a game using the hybrid architecture on
PlanetLab and use a measurement study to demonstrate its advantages
over a client-server architecture.
