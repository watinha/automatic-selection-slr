Life-cycle of the games industry: the specificities of creative industries
This paper assesses the maturity of the games industry. The indicators
of industry maturity posited in the industry life-cycle theory are
discussed. The economic characteristics of creative, or cultural,
industries are listed. Empirical work is done on the concentration
of the international game development sector based on UK sales. The
growth of the Finnish games industry is analyzed based on original
statistics. The paper concludes that based on this empirical work
the software side of the games industry is far from mature. Explanations
for this finding are proposed based on the characteristics of the
games industry in particular and the creative industries in general.
