Explaining the enjoyment of playing video games: the role of competition
The tremendous and still growing popularity of computer and video  	games has inspired Communication Researchers and Media Psychologists  	to investigate the factors of the enjoyment experienced by the players.  	Apparently, the games' interactivity allows for a continuous stream  	of challenging and competitive situations that have to be resolved  	by the players. Competition is therefore regarded a key element of  	the explanation of players' entertainment experience. Subsequent  	to a theoretical explication, empirical evidence for the role of  	competition in the playing process and the impact of competitiveness  	for selective exposure to computer games is reported from a field  	experiment (N = 349) and an online survey study (N = 795).
