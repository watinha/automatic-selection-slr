Developing an augmented reality racing game
Augmented reality (AR) makes it possible to create games in which  	virtual objects are overlaid on the real world, and real objects  	are tracked and used to control virtual ones. We describe the development  	of an AR racing game created by modifying an existing racing game,  	using an AR infrastructure that we developed for use with the XNA  	game development platform. In our game, the driver wears a tracked  	video see-through head-worn display, and controls the car with a  	passive tangible controller. Other players can participate by manipulating  	waypoints that the car must pass and obstacles with which the car  	can collide. We discuss our AR infrastructure, which supports the  	creation of AR applications and games in a managed code environment,  	the user interface we developed for the AR racing game, the game's  	software and hardware architecture, and feedback and observations  	from early demonstrations.
