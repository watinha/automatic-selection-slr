Architecture for a massively multiplayer online role playing game
engine
Faster networks, faster processors and 3D accelerator cards have contributed
to the push for a new genre of online games, the Massively Multiplayer
Online Role Playing Game, MMORPG. This paper presents a high-level
software architecture for building a MMORPG engine. Six goals for
the architecture are set, the architecture is presented and then
examined to determine how well the goals have been met. The architecture
blends in a unique way several classical software architecture patterns,
using the strength of each to achieve the goals for the system.
