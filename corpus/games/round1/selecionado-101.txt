Playability heuristics for mobile multi-player games
Multi-player games are engaging because of social interaction and
competing with real players. Currently, many digital games are multi-player
or have multi-player features. When evaluating the playability of
multi-player games, we need to consider player-to-player interaction.
In this paper, we introduce and describe playability heuristics for
mobile multi-player games that complement the playability heuristic
model that we have presented earlier. Multi-player heuristics have
been developed by identifying playability problems in game evaluations
and comparing these findings to game design guidelines and other
studies found in the literature. The results indicate that the presented
multi-player heuristics correspond to issues that are addressed to
be important in multi-player games.
