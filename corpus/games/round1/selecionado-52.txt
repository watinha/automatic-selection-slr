ScriptEase: A generative/adaptive programming paradigm for game scripting
The traditional approach to implementing interactions between a player
character (PC) and objects in computer games is to write scripts
in a procedural scripting language. These scripts are usually so
complex that they must be written by a computer programmer rather
than by the author of the game story. This interruption in the game
story authoring process has two distinct disadvantages: it increases
the cost of game production and it introduces a disconnect between
the authors intentions and the interactions produced from the programmers
written scripts. We introduce a mechanism to solve these problems.
We show that game authors (non-programmers) can generate the necessary
scripts for implementing meaningful interactions between the PC and
game objects using a three-step process. In the first step, the author
uses a generative pattern (concept) to create a high-level description
of a commonly occurring game scenario. In the second step, the author
uses a standard set of adaptation operations to customize the high-level
description to the particular circumstances of the story that is
being told. In the third step, the author presses a button that automatically
generates scripting code from the adapted pattern. We describe the
results of three studies in which a combined total of 56 game story
authors used this three-step process to construct Neverwinter Nights
game stories, using a tool called ScriptEase. We believe that this
generative/adaptive process is the key to future game story scripting.
More generally, this article advocates the development of adaptive
programming as an alternative to current constructive programming
techniques, as well as the application of adaptive programming in
many domains.
