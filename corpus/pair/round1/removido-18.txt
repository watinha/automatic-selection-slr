Collaborative programming projects in an advanced CS course
There is ongoing discussion regarding the benefits of collaborative  	programming in software development. This paper presents the results  	of a collaborative programming research conducted at the Open University  	of Israel which is a distance learning institution. The research  	was conducted during the academic year of 2005 in the course "Advanced  	Programming in Java Workshop", given in the Computer Science Department.  	The workshop is based primarily on J2EE technologies and requires  	the students to hand in a final project. We investigated the collaborative  	programming work in the workshop. Our results support the use of  	collaborative programming as an effective programming technique.
