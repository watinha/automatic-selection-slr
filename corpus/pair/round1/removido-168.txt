Case study: extreme programming in a university environment
Extreme programming (XP) is a new and controversial software process  	for small teams. A practical training course at the University of  	Karlsruhe led to the following observations about the key practices  	of XP. First, it is unclear how to reap the potential benefits of  	pair programming, although pair programming produces high-quality  	code. Second, designing in small increments appears to be problematic  	but ensures rapid feedback about the code. Third, while automated  	testing is helpful, writing test cases before coding is a challenge.  	Last, it is difficult to implement XP without coaching. This paper  	also provides some guidelines for those starting out with XP.
