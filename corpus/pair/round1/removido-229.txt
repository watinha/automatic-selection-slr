An open source simulation model of software development and testing
This paper describes a new discrete event simulation model built using
a mathematical tool (Matlab) to investigate the simulation of the
programming and the testing phases of a software development project.
In order to show how the model can be used and to provide some preliminary
concrete results, we give three examples of how this model can be
utilized to examine the effect of adopting different strategies for
coding and testing a new software system. Specifically, we provide
results of simulation runs intended to simulate the effects on the
coding and testing phases of different testing strategies, the adoption
of pair programming in an otherwise-unchanged process, and the automation
of testing.
