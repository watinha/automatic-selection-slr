Dialog-based protocol: an empirical research method for cognitive
activities in software engineering
This paper proposes dialog-based protocol for the study of the cognitive
activities during software development and evolution. The dialog-based
protocol, derived from the idea of pair programming, is a significant
alternative to the common think-aloud protocol, because it lessens
the Hawthorne and placebo effects. Using screen-capturing and voice
recording instead of videotaping further reduces the Hawthorne effect.
The self-directed learning theory provides an encoding scheme and
can be used in analyzing the data. A case study illustrates this
new approach.
