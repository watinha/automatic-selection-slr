Building pair programming knowledge through a family of experiments
Pair programming is a practice in which two programmers work collaboratively  	at one computer on the same design, algorithm, code, or test. Pair  	programming is becoming increasingly popular in industry and in university  	curricula. A family of experiments was run with over 1200 students  	at two US universities, North Carolina State University and the University  	of California Santa Cruz, to assess the efficacy of pair programming  	as an alternative learning technique in introductory programming  	courses. Students who used the pair programming technique were at  	least as likely to complete the introductory course with a grade  	of C or better when compared with students who used the solo programming  	technique. Paired students earned exam and project scores equal to  	or better than solo students. Paired students had a positive attitude  	toward collaboration and were significantly more likely to be registered  	as computer science-related majors one year later. Our findings also  	suggest that students in paired classes continue to be successful  	in subsequent programming classes continue to be successful in subsequent  	programming classes that require solo programming.
