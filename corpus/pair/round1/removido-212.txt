Pair Programming and Agile Software Development: Experiences in a
College Setting
While agile software development methodologies are now becoming more
commonplace in industry, they have yet to be fully embraced by academic
institutions. To better prepare university students for the marketplace,
it is important that students are familiar with these alternative
software development methods. For those unacquainted with agile methodologies,
this paper first provides a summary of agile practices and a review
of reports on teaching these practices in college classrooms. Next
it discusses a study that the authors conducted in a graduate course
entitled Software Development Process Models, in which the students
were required to use eXtreme Programming practices. The discussion
describes course assignments and the results from a survey that was
administered to assess studentsâ€™ perceptions of their experiences
using pair programming and agile methods.
