Inspecting Automated Test Code: A Preliminary Study
Testing is an essential part of an agile process as test is automated  	and tends to take the role of specifications in place of documents.  	However, whenever test cases are faulty, developersâ€™ time might be  	wasted to fix problems that do not actually originate in the production  	code. Because of their relevance in agile processes, we posit that  	the quality of test cases can be assured through software inspections  	as a complement to the informal review activity which occurs in pair  	programming. Inspections can thus help the identification of what  	might be wrong in test code and where refactoring is needed. In this  	paper, we report on a preliminary empirical study where we examine  	the effect of conducting software inspections on automated test code.  	First results show that software inspections can improve the quality  	of test code, especially the repeatability attribute. The benefit  	of software inspections also apply when automated unit tests are  	created by developers working in pair programming mode.
