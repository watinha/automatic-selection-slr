Engineering-based processes and agile methodologies for software
development: a comparative case study
The emergence of various software development methodologies raises
the need to evaluate and compare their efficiencies. One way of performing
such a comparison is to have different teams apply different process
models in the implementation of multiple versions of common specifications.
This study defines a new cognitive activity classification scheme
which has been used to record the effort expended by six student
teams producing parallel implementations of the same software requirements
specifications. Three of the teams used a process based on the Unified
Process for Education (UPEDU), a teaching-oriented process derived
from the Rational Unified Process. The other three teams used a process
built around the principles of the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology.
Important variations in effort at the cognitive activity level between
teams shows that the classification could scarcely be used without
categorization at a higher level. However, the relative importance
of a category of activities aimed at defining "active" behaviour
was shown to be almost constant for all teams involved, possibly
showing a fundamental behaviour pattern. As secondary observations,
aggregate variations by process model tend to be small and limited
to a few activities, and coding-related activities dominate the effort
distribution for all the teams.
