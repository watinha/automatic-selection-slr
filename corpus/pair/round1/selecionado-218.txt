On Pair Rotation in the Computer Science Course
In a course environment, pairing a student with one partner for the
entire semester is beneficial, but may not be optimal. The authors
conducted a study in two undergraduate levelcourses to observe the
advantages and disadvantages of pair rotation whereby a student pairs
with several different students throughout the semester. This paper
summarizes teaching staff and student perceptions on the viability
of pair rotation. Teachers find pair rotation valuable because the
teaching staff can obtain multiple peer evaluations on each student
and because dysfunctional pairs are regularly disbanded. However,
pair rotation adds to the burden of assigning pairs multiple times
per semester. The majority of students in the study perceived pair
rotation to be a desirable approach. Additionally, most students
considered peer evaluation to be an effective means of providing
feedback to teaching staff. However, they did not significantly believe
that peer evaluation was an effective means for motivating students.
