Attitudes on using pair-programming
During a research study conducted over four semesters, students enrolled
in an introductory programming class at a commuter campus used the
pair-programming approach for both in-class labs and out-of-class
programming assignments. This study was a comprehensive assessment
of pair-programming using multiple measures of both quantitative
and qualitative feedback about students' experiences with pair-programming.
The results show that overwhelmingly, students reported positive
reactions to working with a partner using the pair-programming paradigm.
As expected at a commuter campus, the most common challenge students
reported was difficulty of coordinating schedules. This article provides
the results of the study and offers suggestions for managing pair-programming
on a commuter campus.
