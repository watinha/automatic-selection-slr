Reflections on 10 years of sponsored senior design projects: Students
win-clients win!
Undergraduate computer science degree programs often provide an opportunity
for students to experience real software projects as a part of their
programs of study. These experiences frequently reside in a course
in which students form software development teams, are assigned to
a project offered by a corporate sponsor and devote one or two semesters
to the task of making progress on the project. In an ideal model,
faculty mentor student teams who, in turn, behave as subcontractors
or consultants to the sponsor. Students work for a grade, not directly
for the sponsor as a true subcontractor would. In the ideal model,
students demonstrate what they have learned about software engineering
process, as well as their ability to implement programmed solutions.
Student teams provide progress reports, both oral and written, and
directly experience many of the challenges and successes of true
software engineering professionals. This paper reports on one such
program after 10 years of operation. The technologies and software
development processes of student projects are summarized and presented
as an informal survey. Student response is discussed in terms of
software systems they produced and how they went about producing
them. The maturation of these students as software engineering professionals
is also discussed.
