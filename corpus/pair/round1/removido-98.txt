Sangam - A Distributed Pair Programming Plug-in for Eclipse
In pair programming, two programmers traditionally work side-by-side
at one computer. However, in globally distributed organizations,
long-distance collaboration is frequently necessary. Sangam is an
Eclipse plug-in that allows Eclipse users in different locations
to share a workspace so that they may work as if they were using
the same computer. In this paper, we discuss the Sangam plug-in,
and our experience developing it via distributed and collocated pair
programming.
