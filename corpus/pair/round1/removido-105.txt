Teaching Computer Science Courses Using Extreme Programming (XP)
Methodology
This paper describes the extreme programming (XP) methodology and
its effectiveness in incorporating its practices in computer science
curriculum. We explored several merits and demerits of this incorporation
based on our experiences and observations which are supported by
other researchers. In this study we considered those courses of computer
science that involve the processes of software development and analysis.
It has been found that XP in full practice is vulnerable against
a single course of software engineering, so some of its practices
should be incorporated in the first semester of computer science
curriculum and rest should be incorporated in later years. We start
our work from the introductory course in computer science where we
first implement the concept of pair programming and then implement
other practices. Some suggestions are included in this work that
can be helpful in implementing this methodology.
