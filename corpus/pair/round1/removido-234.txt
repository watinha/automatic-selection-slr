Empirical validation of pair programming
This paper discusses an empirical assessment of pair programming.
Several agile processes arose and have been adopted in industry with
the promise of producing working software in the early phases of
production process and to make the organization flexible and adaptable
with respect to the changing environment. The outcomes of the experiments
can be summarized as follows: (i) pair programming improves the productivity
of developers with respect to solo programming; (ii) it also fosters
knowledge transfer between the developers of the pair: the experiment
suggests that this effect is emphasized when both the components
own the same educational background; and, finally, (iii) distributing
the components of a pair could seriously deteriorate expected benefits,
if an appropriate support for communication and collaboration is
not set up.
