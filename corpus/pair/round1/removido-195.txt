Dear diary: the making of an XP team
The author discusses his experience working with a software technology  	company during the introduction of XP. While there had been some  	success at employing practices such as the planning game, stand-up  	meetings, and pair programming, the company was struggling. He realized  	the biggest thing they were lacking was the concept that XP is about  	the team delivering great software, not the individual or a group  	of individuals. His first challenge, then, was to help them become  	a team. A a journal of events that occurred while I was working with  	this team of 10 developers is presented.
