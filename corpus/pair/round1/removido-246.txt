Pair Programming: Experience the Difference
Pair programming is emerging as an important technique for developing
higher quality code, faster. With pair programming, two software
developers work on one computer, collaborating on the same design,
algorithm, code, or test. This tutorial examines pair programming
research results and anecdotal experiences of programmers who have
transitioned to pair programming. It will discuss what works and
what doesn’t and will also explain techniques for fostering support
in making a transition to pair programming – support from management
and support from peers. Hands-on activities will be used to demonstrate
pair programming benefits.
