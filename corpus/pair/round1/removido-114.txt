Pair programming: An alternative to reviews and inspections?
The benefits of pair programming in relation to reviews and inspections  	applied to software development are discussed. Pair programming is  	defined as a practice in which two programmers sit side by side at  	one computer for developing software. Pair programming supports a  	higher focus on the task as a result of the peer pressure that comes  	along with it. Program code knowledge is distributed among two or  	more developers as soon as the code is typed. It is suggested that  	traditional QA processes, such as inspections and reviews, must be  	adapted to accommodate today's need for distributed development,  	low overhead, electronic processing, and storage of process data  	and artifacts.
