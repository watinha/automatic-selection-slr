How and Why Collaborative Software Development Impacts the Software
Engineering Course
This paper presents the results of an initial quantitative investigation
to assess a variety of factors that potentially affect the collaborative
software development experience. This research was conducted with
119 students in two undergraduate software engineering classes at
North Carolina State University. A survey was administered where
students could reflect on their collaborative experiences. We analyzed
these factors for interrelationships as well as for correlations
with performance in the course, grade point average, and SAT scores.
Our findings support the components of the proposed Social Interaction
Model of Pair Programming. The substantiation of the Social Interaction
Model of Pair Programming values suggests that they should be considered
in course planning. We also find that work ethic and self-perceived
programming ability positively correlate with GPA.
