Towards Increasing the Compatibility of Student Pair Programmers
As pair programming is used widely in software engineering education,  	instructors may wish to proactively form pairs to increase the likelihood  	of compatible pairs. A study involving 361 software engineering students  	was carried out at North Carolina State University to understand  	and predict pair compatibility. We have found that students are compatible  	with partners whom they perceive of similar skill, although instructors  	cannot proactively manage this perception. Pairing of two minority  	students is more likely and mixed gender pairs are less likely to  	be compatible. Additionally, pairing of students with similar actual  	skill level as measured by midterm grades in class, GPA, and SAT/GRE  	scores also likely results in compatible pairs. Our research addresses  	the following challenges faced by instructors in software engineering:  	1) organizational concern in pairing of students; 2) increasing the  	retention rates of female and minority students in classes; and 3)  	proactively forming mutually-compatible pairs.
