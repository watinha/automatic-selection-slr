Experiments with industry's "pair-programming" model in the computer
science classroom
Anecdotal evidence from several sources, primarily in industry, indicates
that two programmers working collaboratively on the same design,
algorithm, code, or test perform substantially better than the two
working alone. Two courses taught at the University of Utah studied
the use of this technique, often called pair-programming or collaborative
programming, in the undergraduate computer science classroom. The
students applied a positive form of "pair-pressure" on each other,
which proved beneficial to the quality of their work products. The
students also benefit from "pair-learning" which allowed them to
learn new languages faster and better than with solitary learning.
The workload of the teaching staff is reduced because the students
more often look to each other for technical support and advice.
