Teaching extreme programming to large groups of students
We find the extreme programming methodology highly suitable for introducing  	undergraduate students to software engineering. To be able to apply  	this methodology at a reasonable teaching cost for large student  	groups, we have developed two courses that work in tandem: a team  	programming course taken by more than 100 students, and a coaching  	course taken by around 25 students. In this paper we describe our  	view of how extreme programming fits into the software engineering  	curriculum, our approach to teaching it, and our experiences, based  	on two years of running these courses. Particularly important aspects  	of our set up include team coaching (by older students), fixed working  	hours, and colocation during development. Our experiences so far  	are very positive, and we see that students get a good basic understanding  	of the important concepts in software engineering, rooted in their  	own practical experience.
