A case study in the use of extreme programming in an academic environment
A group of graduate students working in a lab in a university have  	more distractions than a typical software development group in industry.  	With more distractions and fewer hours on site does it still make  	sense to use extreme programming (XP) in the development of software?  	Here we discuss our experience using XP in an academic environment  	in which the members of the development group have different schedules  	and other projects. We found that pair programming was an efficient  	and effective way to learn and share knowledge, and that unit testing  	and just-in-time design helped us get to an early, though scaled  	down release. Our interpretation of pair programming felt limited  	and awkward at first until we realized that we could and should spend  	time independently learning and researching the tasks in addition  	to the work we do in pairs.
