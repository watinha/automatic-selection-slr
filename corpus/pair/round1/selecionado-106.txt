An empirical analysis on the discontinuous use of pair programming
Pair programming has been shown to increase communication and teamwork
skills and to provide better code. The aim of this work is to show
the efficacy of pair programming in transferring knowledge and skills
over an environment where people met only occasionally. In a quasi
experiment, we find that pair programming is effective in sharing
knowledge among 15 students who met once a week for a half day, and
did their internship individually or in couple for the remaining
4 half days.
