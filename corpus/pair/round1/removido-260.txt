Experimental evaluation of two approaches to software artefacts review
The classical approach to software artefacts review is based on two  	phases: first a developer produces an artefact (design, code etc.),  	and then a reviewer (or reviewers) check quality. That paradigm has  	been changed recently by a software development methodology called  	Extreme Programming (XP). One of key practices of XP is pair programming:  	while one programmer writes code the other is performing on-line  	review, i.e. programming and reviewing are performed in the same  	phase (simultaneously). In the paper an experiment is described that  	aimed at comparing those two approaches to software review.
