Pair Programming in Graduate Software Engineering Course Projects
Pair programming has been used in undergraduate classes in order to  	develop student skills and to enhance student learning. Experiments  	with such an approach have demonstrated positive effects. This paper  	investigates the effects of pair programming in the graduate software  	engineering class by conducting a case study with six students who  	were assigned to work on incremental changes on an open source application  	either as pairs or as individuals. The results of the case study  	showed that paired students completed their change request tasks  	faster and with higher quality than individuals. They also wrote  	less lines of code and used more meaningful variable names. Pair  	programming could be an effective and useful approach for graduate  	software engineering classes.
