Exclusion, assumptions, and misinterpretation: foes of collaboration
It all started when I was reviewing the comments on an e-question  	posed by M. Heller, executive Web editor of CIO magazine: "Would  	agile software development work in your shop?" As someone who is  	very interested in the practices and, more importantly, the philosophies  	of the agile approaches, I wanted to see what the consensus was.  	I personally have witnessed some surprisingly emotional responses  	from ClOs about the agile approaches: it would never work, it was  	just RAD, prototyping was a bad idea, pair programming was too expensive,  	and so on. I expected to see more of that. There are still men who  	believe that women will always be less technically talented. Society  	may not allow them to say it anymore, but the choices they make confirm  	the belief. Most, I am sure, are not conscious of this belief. Some  	of the articles written by IT professionals, including some in the  	Cutter journals, sound pompous, judgmental, and egotistical, not  	just toward women, but toward anyone who does not share their particular  	view. Dialog is replaced with a good, tough competition, with someone's  	winning requiring that others lose. It strikes me how important it  	is for all of us, regardless of sex, race, or nationality (to say  	nothing of methodology preference!) to set aside the petty focus  	on differences that keep us from connecting. We must all work hard  	to reach out to others, to respect their opinions and skills, even  	when they are different from our own. We must invest time in all  	relationships around us, as we have learned how truly fragile they  	all are. We must be the glue to heal our world. IT has an amazing  	amount of power to do just that, a power as yet untapped .
