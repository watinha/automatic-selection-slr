A Cross-program investigation of students' perception of agile methods
Research was conducted on using agile methods in software engineering  	education. This paper explores the perceptions of students from five  	different academic levels of agile practices. Information has been  	gathered through the collection of quantitative and qualitative data  	over three academic years, and analysis reveals student experiences,  	mainly positive but also some negative. Student opinions indicate  	the preference to continue to use agile practices at the workplace  	if allowed. A way these findings may potentially be extrapolated  	to the industrial settings is discussed. Finally, this report should  	encourage other academics considering adoption of agile methods in  	their computer science or software engineering curricula.
