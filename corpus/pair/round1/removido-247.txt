Experimenting with industry's "Pair-Programming" model in the Computer
Science classroom
Anecdotal evidence from several sources, primarily in industry, indicates
that two programmers working collaboratively on the same design,
algorithm, code, or test perform substantially better than the two
would working alone. Two courses taught at the University of Utah
studied the use of this technique, often called pair-programming
or collaborative programming,

in the undergraduate computer science classroom. The students applied
a positive form of “pair-pressure” on each other, which proved beneficial
to the quality of their work products. The students also benefit
from “pair-learning,” which allowed them to learn new languages faster
and better than with solitary learning. The workload of the teaching
staff is reduced because the students more often look to each other
for technical support and advice.
