Empirical study on the productivity of the pair programming
Many authors complain the lack of empirical studies which assess the
benefits and the drawbacks of agile practices. Particularly, pair
programming rises an interesting question for managers: does pair
programming mean to pay two developers in the place of one? We realized
an experiment to compare the productivity of a developer when performing
pair programming and when working as solo programmer. We obtained
empirical evidence that pair programming decreases the effort of
the single programmer.
