Virtual teaming: Experiments and experiences with distributed pair  	programming
Pair programming is a practice in which two programmers work together  	at one computer, collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code  	or test. Previous studies have shown that pair programmers produce  	higher quality code in essentially the same amount of time as solo  	programmers. Additional benefits include increased job satisfaction,  	improved team communication, and efficient tacit knowledge sharing.  	However, it may not always be possible for all team members to be  	collocated due to the rise in teleworking and geographically distributed  	teams. This paper analyzes the results of two distributed pair programming  	case studies done at UNC Chapel Hill and at NC State University.  	Participants used readily available off-the-shelf applications for  	collaborative software development. The results indicate that software  	development collaboratively "over the wire" is feasible, effective,  	and pleasant for the participants; distributed development is better  	done as synchronous pairs than as individuals who integrate; and  	distributed pairs maintain many of the advantages of collocated pairs.
