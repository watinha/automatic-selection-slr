The costs and benefits of pair programming
Pair or collaborative programming is where two programmers develop
software side by side at one computer. Using interviews and controlled
experiments, the authors investigated the costs and benefits of pair
programming. They found that for a development-time cost of about
15%, pair programming improves design quality, reduces defects, reduces
staffing risk, enhances technical skills, improves team communications
and is considered more enjoyable at statistically significant levels.
