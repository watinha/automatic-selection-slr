Voices of women in a software engineering course: Reflections on
collaboration
Those science, mathematics, and engineering faculty who are serious
about making the education they offer as available to their daughters
as to their sons are, we posit, facing the prospect of dismantling
a large part of its traditional pedagogical structure, along with
the assumptions and practice which support it. [Seymour and Hewett
1997]. Prior research indicates that female students can be concerned
about the insularity of working alone for long periods of time, as
they perceive to be the case with computer science and information
technology careers. We studied an advanced undergraduate software
engineering course at North Carolina State University to characterize
the potential of collaborative learning environments created via
pair-programming and agile software development to ameliorate this
concern. A collective case study of three representative women in
the course revealed that they held the following four themes in common:
working with others; productivity; confidence; and interest in IT
careers. Three conjectures concerning collaboration emerged from
our study, including the importance of face-to-face meetings, an
increased confidence among women based on product quality, and a
reduction in the amount of time spent on assignments. While our findings
are not generalized to early undergraduate courses, the young women
we studied were at a critical junction in deciding whether to pursue
a career in IT upon their near-term graduation. Additionally, we
propose a model for future testing with both males and females that
connects these three factors with an increased interest in IT careers.
