Ethnographically-informed empirical studies of software practice
Over the past decade we have performed a sustained series of qualitative
studies of software development practice, focusing on social factors.
Using an ethnographically-informed approach, we have addressed four
areas of software practice: software quality management systems,
the emergence of object technology, professional end user development
and agile development. Several issues have arisen from this experience,
including the nature of research questions that such studies can
address, the advantages and challenges associated with being a member
of the community under study, and how to maintain rigour in data
collection. In this paper, we will draw on our studies to illustrate
our approach and to discuss these and other issues.
