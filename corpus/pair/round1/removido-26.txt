Double Trouble: Mixing Qualitative and Quantitative Methods in the  	Study of eXtreme Programmers
Despite sparse and sometimes contradictory evidence, eXtreme Programming  	(XP) is currently growing in popularity as an alternative strategy  	for developing software. This paper proposes a methodology for observational  	studies of one of XPs twelve practices, pair programming, including  	the analysis of verbalisations, interactions and artefacts in order  	to improve our understanding of its cognitive implications. In addition,  	a protocol for analysing pair programming behaviours is included  	as a means of identifying the behavioural differences of those who  	are more expert or novice at pair programming and understanding the  	effect of pairing programmers of differing expertise. Initial results  	from a recent study using this methodology are then presented.
