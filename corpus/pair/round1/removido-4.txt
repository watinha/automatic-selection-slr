A framework for understanding the factors influencing pair programming  	success
Pair programming is one of the more controversial aspects of several  	Agile system development methods, in particular eXtreme Programming  	(XP). Various studies have assessed factors that either drive the  	success or suggest advantages (and disadvantages) of pair programming.  	In this exploratory study the literature on pair programming is examined  	and factors distilled. These factors are then compared and contrasted  	with those discovered in our recent Delphi study of pair programming.  	Gallis et al. (2003) have proposed an initial framework aimed at  	providing a comprehensive identification of the major factors impacting  	team programming situations including pair programming. However,  	this study demonstrates that the framework should be extended to  	include an additional category of factors that relate to organizational  	matters. These factors will be further refined, and used to develop  	and empirically evaluate a conceptual model of pair programming (success).
