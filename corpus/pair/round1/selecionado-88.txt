Program quality with pair programming in CS1
Prior research on pair programming has found that compared to students  	who work alone, students who pair have shown increased confidence  	in their work, greater success in CSl, and greater retention in computer-related  	majors. In these earlier studies, pairing and solo students were  	not given the same programming assignments. This paper reports on  	a study in which this factor was controlled by giving the same programming  	assignments to pairing and solo students. We found that pairing students  	were more likely to turn in working programs, and these programs  	correctly implemented more required features. Our findings were mixed  	when we looked at some standard complexity measures of programs.  	An unexpected but significant finding was that pairing students were  	more likely to submit solutions to their programming assignments.
