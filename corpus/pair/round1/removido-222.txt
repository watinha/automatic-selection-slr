Preliminary Analysis of the effects of pair programming on job satisfaction
Pair programming is one of the most controversial parts of XP. Claims
are mostly based on anecdotal evidence and limited experimentation
performed in classroom settings. This paper reports the preliminary
results of an analysis of the effects of pair programming on job
satisfaction. A questionnaire on pair programming techniques has
been compiled and posted on the web. 108 responses have been collected
from around the world. The preliminary results evidence a very positive
effect of pair programming on job satisfaction.
