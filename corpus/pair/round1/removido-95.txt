Enhancing CS Programming Lab Courses Using Collaborative Editors
This paper describes the pedagogical implications of the GREWPtool
(the Groupware Research in Education and the Workforce Project),
a same time different place groupware tool built to support synchronous,
collaborative coding among small to medium sized groups. GREWPtool
exploits the educational benefits of paired programming while extending
the model to allow students synchronous control of the same code.
This effectively drops the constraints of turn taking, and allows
for a richer interaction. The result was a powerful tool that can
be used to provide interactive lectures, structure classroom activity,
and facilitate paired programming during labs. In this paper we present
the design and use of GREWPtool with an emphasis on how it enhances
the classroom experience. In particular, we give a qualitative analysis
of how this tool has been used in six lab courses over the past two
years.
