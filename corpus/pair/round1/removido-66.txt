Agile modeling, agile software development, and extreme programming:  	the state of research
While there are many claims for the successful use of extreme programming  	(XP) and agile modeling (AM), and the proponents can often be vocal  	in the extreme regarding their supposed benefits, research evidence  	supporting proponents' claims is somewhat lacking. Currently, the  	only research appearing to investigate the phenomena consists of  	two prominent streams. A small number of case studies and experience  	reports that generally promote the success of XP in various development  	environments, and a well-established stream of research into pair  	programming has generated results that in part support the idea of  	XP. Research into AM appears to be even more sparse than that for  	XP. Case studies, comparative analyses, and experience reports comprise  	the majority of the research in the area, while very few empirical  	research efforts have been conducted. This article reviews the state  	of research in XP and AM, and recommends areas that could benefit  	from further study. Since nearly all empirical XP research relates  	to pair programming, a closer look into the unstudied XP core practices  	would be beneficial, although interaction between related core practice  	areas could confound such efforts. It might also be possible to group  	related core XP concepts and study the groups individually. Finally,  	there are those who claim that XP and AM, or even agility in general,  	are really nothing more than a repackaging of old concepts. This  	claim needs to be investigated .
