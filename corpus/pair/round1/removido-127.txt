Motivations and measurements in an agile case study
With the recent emergence of agile software development technologies,
the software community is awaiting sound, empirical investigation
of the mpacts of agile practices in a live setting. One means of
conducting such research is through industrial case studies. There
are a number of influencing factors that contribute to the success
of such a case study. In this paper, we describe a case study performed
at Sabre Airline SolutionsTM evaluating the effects of adopting Extreme
Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically
plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related
results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry
averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average
post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We
discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics
of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data
collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study.
We identify four factors that potentially impact the outcome of industrial
case studies: availability of data, tool support, cooperative personnel
and project status. Recognizing and planning for these factors is
essential to conducting industrial case studies.
