Programming in pairs with Alice to improve confidence, enjoyment,
and achievement
Students in an introductory computing class participated in a study
investigating the impact of using a graphics programming environment
(Alice) and pair-programming on confidence, enjoyment and achievement.
Sixty-four participants completed a short questionnaire and a content
pre-test about computer programming concepts. Students were then
assigned to one of two groups: individual or paired. The pairs completed
a tutorial on Alice and then completed a short assignment over a
period of one week working as a team of two. The individuals completed
the same tutorial and assignment but completed it alone. Lastly,
all participants took the same questionnaire and content post-test.
The results showed that all students experienced increased confidence
in programming, that students in pairs enjoyed programming more than
students who worked individually, and that all students performed
significantly better on the content post-test.
