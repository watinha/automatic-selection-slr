Method engineering for OO systems development
For the past 15 years, many proposed OO methodologies have sought
to deliver full life-cycle support for systems development using
OO tools. Many are highly prescriptive, that is, the methodology
elements are highly interconnected. This inherent complexity makes
it difficult for a methodology to be adapted to project-specific
circumstances, especially (and usually) when project managers and
developers are advised by the methodology's creator that they must
use all or none of the components of the methodology. Indeed, even
with the advent of agile methodologies, frequently touted by their
developers as offering more people-focus and flexibility, proponents
often say an agile methodology like extreme programming (XP) is followed
in its entirety and that XP without, say, pair programming is not
XP. This metamodel-based framework helps distill the key ingredients
in software engineering processes in ways that facilitate method
engineering, along with process understanding.
