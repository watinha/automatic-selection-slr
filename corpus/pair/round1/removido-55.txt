Paired programming \& personality traits
Paired programming is an essential element of extreme programming
--a methodology comprised of applying best practices to software
development. Not all developers are suited for paired development
however, and care should be taken when building a team for extreme
programming. The team members should be selected with personality
traits that are beneficial to paired programming. These personality
traits can be determined through various interview techniques and
the corresponding behavioral responses of the candidates.
