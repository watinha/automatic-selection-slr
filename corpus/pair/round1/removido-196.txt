Tracking Test First Pair Programming - An Experiment
The authors ran an experiment where a group of professional programmers  	working in pairs and a control group programming alone implemented  	a small system from predefined requirements. Most programmers spent  	between 50% and 60% of time on testing; only the most inexperienced  	spent less. Programmers reported more problems with refactoring than  	testing. The rhythm of switching the driver and navigator role is  	essential for test-first pair programming. The experiment showed  	that partners switched roles 21 times per day on average. The comparison  	of the control group of individuals and the group programming in  	pairs showed that both groups spent almost the same amount of time  	to complete the tasks. The result of this comparison is by applying  	a t-test not statistically significant. We believe that more detailed  	research apart of evaluating test-first programming is needed to  	compare solo vs. pair programming in the investigated group.
