Formal extreme (and extremely formal) programming
This paper is an exploratory work where the authors study how the  	technology of formal methods (FM) can interact with agile process  	in general and with extreme programming (XP) in particular. Our thesis  	is that most of XP practices (pair programming , daily build , the  	simplest design or the metaphor ) are technology independent and  	therefore can be used in FM based developments. Additionally, other  	essential pieces like test first , incremental development and refactoring  	can be improved by using FM. In the paper we explore in a certain  	detail those pieces: when you write a formal specification you are  	saying what your code must do, when you write a test you are doing  	the same so the idea is to use formal specifications as tests. Incremental  	development is quite similar to the refinement process in FM: specifications  	evolve to code maintaining previous functionality. Finally FM can  	help to remove redundancy, eliminate unused functionality and transform  	obsolete designs into new ones, and this is refactoring.
