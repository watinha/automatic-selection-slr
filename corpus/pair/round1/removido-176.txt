On the impact of warmup phases on the economics of pair programming
Pair programmers need a "warmup phase" before the pair can work at
full speed. We study how large the impact of the lower productivity
during warmup is on the business value of a pair programming project.
To this end, we extend our net present value model for pair programming
to explicitly include a learning interval for pairs. We then carry
out a simulation study where we vary the shape of the learning curve,
the length of the learning interval, the final productivity level
of the pairs, the market pressure, and the size of the workforce.
Our simulations show that the cost of the warmup phase is small compared
to the project value. This result suggests that the learning overhead
is not an obstacle to introducing and using pair programming.
