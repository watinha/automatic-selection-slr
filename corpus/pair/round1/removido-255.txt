Extreme programming for software engineering education?
The eXtreme Programming (XP) software development methodology, has
received considerable attention in recent years. The adherents of
XP anecdotally extol its benefits, particularly as a method that
is highly responsive to changing customer's desires. While XP has
acquired numerous vocal advocates, the interactions and dependencies
between XP practices have not been adequately studied. Good software
engineering practice requires expertise in a complex set of activities
that involve the intellectual skills of planning, designing, evaluating,
and revising. The authors explore the practices of XP in the context
of software engineering education. To do so, one must examine the
practices of XP as they influence the acquisition of software engineering
skills. The practices of XP, in combination or isolation, may provide
critical features to aid or hinder the development of increasingly
capable practitioners. This paper evaluates the practices of XP in
the context of acquiring these necessary software engineering skills.
