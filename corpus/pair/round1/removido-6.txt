An empirical study of relationships among extreme programming engineering  	activities
Extreme programming (XP) is an agile software process that promotes  	early and quick production of working code. In this paper, we investigated  	the relationship among three XP engineering activities: new design,  	refactoring, and error fix. We found that the more the new design  	performed to the system the less refactoring and error fix were performed.  	However, the refactoring and error fix efforts did not seem to be  	related. We also found that the error fix effort is related to number  	of days spent on each story, while new design is not. The relationship  	between the refactoring effort and number of days spent on each story  	was not conclusive.
