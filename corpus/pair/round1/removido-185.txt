Adapting Pair Programming Pedagogy for use in Computer Literacy Courses
Pair programming is a key component of the Extreme Programming (XP)
software development methodology and involves two programmers working
at the same workstation to create code. Pair programming pedagogy,
based on this approach of sharing a workstation, has proven to be
successful in teaching programming to undergraduate students. The
tasks assigned to students in computer literacy courses differ significantly
from the task of developing a program: the former have students develop
predefined products using commercial applications by following step-by-step
instructions whereas the latter have students apply problem solving
skills to design and develop a unique solution. Because the types
of tasks differ, pair programming pedagogy must be adapted prior
to use in computer literacy courses. Pair programming

pedagogy is a recent and specific application of the older and more
general collaborative learning. Therefore, the critical attributes
of successful collaborative learning approaches are used to structure
this adaptation of pair programming pedagogy.
