Process support and knowledge management for virtual teams doing
agile software development
Agile practices are arguably improving the productivity of small,
co-located software development teams. We describe an approach that
tries to overcome the constraint of co-location by introducing a
process-support environment (called MILOS) that helps software development
teams to maintain adaptive practices in a distributed setting. MILOS
supports project coordination, information routing, team communication,
pair programming and experience management.
