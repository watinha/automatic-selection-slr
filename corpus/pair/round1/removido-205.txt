Using Bayesian belief networks to model software project management  	antipatterns
In spite of numerous traditional and agile software project management  	models proposed, process and project modeling still remains an open  	issue. This paper proposes a Bayesian network (BN) approach for modeling  	software project management antipatterns. This approach provides  	a framework for project managers, who would like to model the cause-effect  	relationships that underlie an antipattern, taking into account the  	inherent uncertainty of a software project. The approach is exemplified  	through a specific BN model of an antipattern. The antipattern is  	modeled using the empirical results of a controlled experiment on  	extreme programming (XP) that investigated the impact of developer  	personalities and temperaments on communication, collaboration-pair  	viability and effectiveness in pair programming. The resulting BN  	model provides the precise mathematical model of a project management  	antipattern and can be used to measure and handle uncertainty in  	mathematical terms.
