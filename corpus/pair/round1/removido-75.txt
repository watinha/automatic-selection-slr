Collaboration on software tasks
In pair programming (PP), two developers work together on the same
task using one computer and keyboard. PP involves not just coding,
but many phases of the software development process such as design
and testing. PP has been proposed by several authors since the 70's,
but it is primarily during the last three to four years that some
of the claimed benefits have been tested empirically.
