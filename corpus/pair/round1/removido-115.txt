Extreme programming considered harmful for reliable software development
This paper presents and discusses various facts and data collected
on extreme programming and how this method relates to traditional
software engineering practices. The paper presents reasons, albeit
no scientific proofs, why extreme programming fails to provide answers
to significant questions that contemporary software development methods
have to answer. This paper is an attempt to contribute to a discussion
that is based on data and facts.
