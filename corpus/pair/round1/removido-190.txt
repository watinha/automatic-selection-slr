An evaluation of the degree of agility in six agile methods and its  	applicability for method engineering
While agile methods are in use in industry, little research has been  	undertaken into what is meant by agility and how a supposed agile  	method can be evaluated with regard to its veracity to belong to  	this category of software development methodological approaches.  	Here, an analytical framework, called 4-DAT, is developed and applied  	to six well-known agile methods and, for comparison, two traditional  	methods. The results indicate the degree of agility to be found in  	each method, from which a judgement can be made as to whether the  	appellation of "agile" to that method is appropriate. This information  	is shown to be useful, for example, when constructing a methodology  	from method fragments (method engineering) and when comparing agile  	and traditional methods.
