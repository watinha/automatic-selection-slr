Empirical evaluation of collaborative support for distributed pair
programming
Pair programming is an Extreme Programming (XP) practice where two
programmers work on a single computer to produce an artifact. Empirical
evaluations have provided evidence that this technique results in
higher quality code in half the time it would take an individual
programmer. Distributed pair programming could facilitate opportunistic
pair programming sessions with colleagues working in remote sites.
In this paper, we present the preliminary results of the empirical
evaluation of the COPPER collaborative editor, developed explicitly
to support pair programming. The evaluation was performed on three
different conditions: pairs working collocated on a single computer;
distributed pairs working in application sharing mode; and distributed
pairs using collaboration aware facilities. In all three cases the
subjects used the COPPER collaborative editor. The results support
our hypothesis that distributed pairs could find the same amount
of errors as their collocated counterparts. However, no evidence
was found that the pairs that used collaborative awareness services
had better code comprehension, as we had also hypothesized.
