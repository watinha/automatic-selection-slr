Confirming the influence of educational background in pair-design
knowledge through experiments
The sharing of tacit knowledge is a strategic factor for the success
of software process, from a number of perspectives: training, project
assimilation, and reducing noise in knowledge transfer. Pair programming
is supposed to be a practice suitable for this purpose. Unfortunately,
the building of tacit knowledge is determined by factors that are
difficult to isolate and capture because they concern personal attitude
and capability. Thus, we have focused on the possible causes forming
the individual ability, that can be isolated and studied, such as
the individual education background. We have applied the practice
of working in pairs to the design phase. We have made an experiment
and a replica in academic environment, in order to understand the
relationship between the building of knowledge through the practice
and the individual background. In this paper we discuss the replica
and compare the results with the first experimentâ€™s ones.
