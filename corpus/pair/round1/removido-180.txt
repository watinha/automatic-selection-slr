Extreme Programming from a CMM perspective
Extreme Programming (XP) has been advocated recently as an appropriate
programming method for the high-speed, volatile world of Internet
and Web software development. This popular methodology is

reviewed from the perspective of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
for Software, a five-level model that prescribes process improvement
priorities for software organizations. Overviews of both XP and CMM

are provided, and XP is critiqued from a Software CMM perspective.
The conclusion is that lightweight methodologies such as XP advocate
many good engineering practices, although some practices may be

controversial and counter-productive outside a narrow domain. For
those interested in process improvement, the ideas in XP should be
carefully considered for adoption where appropriate in an

organization's business environment since XP can be used to address
many of the CMM Level 2 and 3 practices. In turn, organizations using
XP should carefully consider the management and infrastructure issues

described in the CMM.
