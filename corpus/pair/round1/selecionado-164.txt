Two controlled experiments concerning the comparison of pair programming
to peer review
This paper reports on two controlled experiments comparing pair programming
with single developers who are assisted by an additional anonymous
peer code review phase. The experiments were conducted in the summer
semester 2002 and 2003 at the University of Karlsruhe with 38 computer
science students. Instead of comparing pair programming to solo programming
this study aims at finding a technique by which a single developer
produces similar program quality as programmer pairs do but with
moderate cost. The study has one major finding concerning the cost
of the two development methods. Single developers are as costly as
programmer pairs, if both programmer pairs and single developers
with an additional review phase are forced to produce programs of
similar level of correctness. In conclusion, programmer pairs and
single developers become interchangeable in terms of development
cost. As this paper reports on the results of small development tasks
the comparison could not take into account long time benefits of
either technique.
