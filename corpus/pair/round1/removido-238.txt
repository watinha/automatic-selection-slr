Pair-Programming Helps Female Computer Science Students
Pair-programming has been found to be very beneficial in educational  	settings. Students who pair in their introductory programming course  	are more confident, have greater course completion and pass rates,  	and are more likely to persist in computer-related majors. Although  	pairing helps all students, we believe that it is particularly beneficial  	for women because it addresses several significant factors that limit  	women's participation in computer science. We provide reasons for  	our belief that pair-programming helps women persist in these majors.  	We also repeat, with special emphasis on the impact on women, some  	details published elsewhere regarding our experiments on pair-programming  	with college and university students. Additionally, we provide new  	data that supports our original findings.
