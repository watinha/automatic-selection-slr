Pair Programming in Software Development Teams An Empirical Study
of its Benefits
We present the results of an extensive and substantial case study
on pair programming, which was carried out in courses for software
development at the University of Dortmund, Germany. 13 software development
teams with about 100 students took part in the experiment. The groups
were divided into two sets with different working conditions. In
one set, the group members worked on their projects in pairs. Even
though the paired teams could only use half of the workstations the
teams of individual workers could use, the paired teams produced
nearly as much code as the teams of individual workers at the same
time. In addition, the code produced by the paired teams was easier
to read and to understand. This facilitates finding errors and maintenance.
