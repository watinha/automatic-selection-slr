Student attitudes toward pair programming
Students in four introductory programming classes who participated  	in a pair programming study had very positive attitudes toward pair  	programming: they liked it, thought that it was fun, would like to  	do it again, and believed that they learned more because they paired.  	Although the students as a whole had positive attitudes, the results  	were not consistent between instructors; in particular, the students  	in one of the courses were significantly less positive about pair  	programming. The implications of instructor-based differences in  	attitude are discussed. This paper also examines the relationship  	between student confidence and attitudes toward pair programming.  	The most confident students liked pairing the most, while the least  	confident students liked it the least. This finding contradicts results  	that have been reported elsewhere.
