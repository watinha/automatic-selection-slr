Examining Impact of Pair Programming on Female Students
There has been low representation of women in Computer Science. Numerous  	studies have been conducted to identify the cause of this under-representation  	and to provide suggestions to improve the situation. Still not much  	progress in attracting women to computer science has been observed.  	The research discussed in this paper was done during the pilot study  	phase of a three-year project about women in information    	technology field. During the first semester of this project, pair  	programming was used in a junior/senior Software Engineering class  	at North Carolina State University. The goal of this research is  	to examine the effect of pair programming on female students. We  	interviewed three female students and analyzed all female students’  	project retrospective reports. Theoretical models were developed  	to describe (a) the source of project    	enjoyment, (b) context that influenced female students’ study habits,  	and (c) the effectiveness of pair programming. The cause and effect  	of each component of the theoretical models were identified and are  	illustrated with narrative data.
