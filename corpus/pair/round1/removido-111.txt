Requirements engineering challenges in market-driven software development  	- An interview study with practitioners
Requirements engineering for market-driven software development entails  	special challenges. This paper presents results from an empirical  	study that investigates these challenges, taking a qualitative approach  	using interviews with fourteen employees at eight software companies  	and a focus group meeting with practitioners. The objective of the  	study is to increase the understanding of the area of market-driven  	requirements engineering and provide suggestions for future research  	by describing encountered challenges. A number of challenging issues  	were found, including bridging communication gaps between marketing  	and development, selecting the right level of process support, basing  	the release plan on uncertain estimates, and managing the constant  	flow of requirements.
