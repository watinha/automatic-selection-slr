Evaluating pair programming with respect to system complexity and
programmer expertise
A total of 295 junior, intermediate, and senior professional Java
consultants (99 individuals and 98 pairs) from 29 international consultancy
companies in Norway, Sweden, and the UK were hired for one day to
participate in a controlled experiment on pair programming. The subjects
used professional Java tools to perform several change tasks on two
alternative Java systems with different degrees of complexity. The
results of this experiment do not support the hypotheses that pair
programming in general reduces the time required to solve the tasks
correctly or increases the proportion of correct solutions. On the
other hand, there is a significant 84 percent increase in effort
to perform the tasks correctly. However, on the more complex system,
the pair programmers had a 48 percent increase in the proportion
of correct solutions but no significant differences in the time taken
to solve the tasks correctly. For the simpler system, there was a
20 percent decrease in time taken but no significant differences
in correctness. However, the moderating effect of system complexity
depends on the programmer expertise of the subjects. The observed
benefits of pair programming in terms of correctness on the complex
system apply mainly to juniors, whereas the reductions in duration
to perform the tasks correctly on the simple system apply mainly
to intermediates and seniors. It is possible that the benefits of
pair programming will exceed the results obtained in this experiment
for larger, more complex tasks and if the pair programmers have a
chance to work together over a longer period of time.
