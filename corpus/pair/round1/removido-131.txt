Value creation and capture: A model of the software development process
Understanding software development dynamics can help managers and  	project team members maximize value delivery. Using functions and  	parameters applied in a spreadsheet, this process model facilitates  	this understanding by examining value creation and value capture  	in the presence of uncertainty. Items to explore include project  	staffing, optimal release dates, and potential impacts of process  	improvements such as pair programming.
