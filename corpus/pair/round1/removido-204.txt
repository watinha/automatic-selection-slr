A non-invasive approach to product metrics collection
Software metrics are useful means in helping software engineers to  	develop large and complex software systems. In the past years, many  	software metrics have been proposed in order to represent several  	different concepts such as complexity, coupling, inheritance, reuse,  	etc. However, this requires the collection of large volumes of metrics  	and, without flexible and transparent tools, is nearly impossible  	to collect data accurately. This paper presents the design and the  	implementation of a tool for collecting and analyzing product metrics  	in a non-invasive way.
