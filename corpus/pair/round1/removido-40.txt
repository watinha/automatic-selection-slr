Activity Patterns of Pair Programming
This paper reports results from an exploratory study investigating
the activity patterns of pair programming using a student project
conducted over a period of nine weeks. We found that pair programming
engaged in activities that lead to more deeper-level thinking which
may enable people to formulate a more complete mental model of the
task. We also compared the activity patterns between different pair
combinations. We found that there are differences in the patterns
among different pair combinations.
