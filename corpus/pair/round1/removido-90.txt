The reflective practitioner perspective in software engineering education
This paper focuses on the application of the reflective practitioner  	(RP) perspective to the profession of software engineering (SE).  	The RP perspective guides professional people to rethink their professional  	creations during and after the accomplishment of the creation process.  	Analysis of the field of SE supports the adoption of the RP perspective  	to SE in general and to SE education in particular. The RP perspective  	emphasizes the studio––the basic training method in architecture  	schools––as the educational environment for design studies. In such  	studios students develop projects with a close guidance of a tutor.  	Analysis of the kind of tasks that architecture students are working  	on and a comparison of these tasks to the problems that SE students  	are facing, suggest that the studio may be an appropriate teaching  	method in SE as well. The paper presents the main ideas of the RP  	perspective and examines its fitness to SE in general and to SE education  	in particular. The discussion is based on analysis of the RP perspective  	and of the SE profession, visits to architecture studios, and conversations  	with tutors in architecture studios and with computing science practitioners.
