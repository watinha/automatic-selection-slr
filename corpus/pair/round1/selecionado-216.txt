Undergraduate student perceptions of pair programming and agile software
methodologies: verifying a model of social interaction
One of the reasons that undergraduate students, particularly women
and minorities, can become disenchanted with computer science education
is because software development is wrongly characterized as a solitary
activity. We conducted a collective case study in a software engineering
course at North Carolina State University to ascertain the effects
of a collaborative pedagogy intervention on student perceptions.
The pedagogy intervention was based upon the practices of agile software
development with a focus on pair programming. Six representative
students in the course participated in the study. Their perspectives
helped validate a social interaction model of student views. The
findings suggest that pair programming and agile software methodologies
contribute to more effective learning opportunities for computer
science students and that students understand and appreciate these
benefits.
