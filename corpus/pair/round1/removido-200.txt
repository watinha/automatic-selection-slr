Student Perceptions of the suitability of Extreme and Pair Programming
Senior students in a software engineering class were asked to write
opinion papers regarding the use of Extreme Programming (XP) in a
software engineering class, and the use of pair programming in an
introductory programming course. The majority of the students were
opposed to using XP in the software engineering class, but favored
the use of pair programming in an introductory programming course.
Early indications from a pilot study in pair programming are consistent
with these opinions. The studentsâ€™ comments are insightful, and should
be considered before introducing either of these practices into the
curriculum.
