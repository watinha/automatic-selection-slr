Do programmer pairs make different mistakes than solo programmers?
Objective: Comparison of program defects caused by programmer pairs  	and solo developers. Design: Analysis of programs developed during  	two counter balanced experiments. Setting: Programming lab at University.  	Experimental units: 42 programs developed by computer science students  	participating in an extreme programming lab course. Main outcome  	measures: Programmer pairs make as many algorithmic mistakes but  	fewer expression mistakes than solo programmers. Results: The second  	result is significant on the 5% level. Conclusions: For simple problems,  	pair programming seems to lead to fewer mistakes than solo programming.
