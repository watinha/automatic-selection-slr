A field study of developer pairs: productivity impacts and implications
Pair programming purportedly delivers quality code with little productivity  	loss. The authors' field study, outside the pair programming environment,  	shows that two-person teams working independently are more productive  	than those working concurrently; agile methods may overcome inherent  	productivity losses of concurrent development. This research contrasts  	starkly with our field study findings. We decided to reexamine our  	earlier productivity data from teams of two and ask: Would our previous  	findings of concurrent-work productivity loss be reversed if we look  	only at programming pairs rather than teams of all sizes? If so,  	we could conclude that pairs are naturally more productive than larger  	teams, regardless of the collaborative process. If not, we could  	conclude that the collaboration mechanisms prescribed in pair programming  	might overcome a natural loss of productivity from concurrent work.  	We offer these findings and their implications as a benchmark against  	which we might measure the potential of pair programming practices.
