Experimenting with pair programming in the classroom
There is now a substantial body of evidence in support of the use
of pair programming in the classroom. Some of the data is anecdotal
and some is the result of formal experiments. We are not aware of
any published data that raises concerns about allowing students to
complete programming projects using pair programming. In this paper
we present data from three studies performed at UCSC. All three studies
support the position that pair programming results in more student
learning.
