Exploring XP for scientific research
Can we successfully apply XP (Extreme Programming) in a scientific
research context? A pilot project at the NASA Langley Research Center
tested XPs applicability in this context. Since the cultural environment
at a government research center differs from the customer-centric
business view, eight of XPs 12 practices seemed incompatible with
the existing research culture. Despite initial awkwardness, the authors
determined that XP can function in situations for which it appears
to be ill suited.
