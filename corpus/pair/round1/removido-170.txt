Pair learning: With an eye toward future success
Pair programming is a practice in which two programmers work collaboratively
at one computer on the same design, algorithm, or code. Prior research
indicates that pair programmers produce higher quality code in essentially
half the time taken by solo programmers. Pair programming is becoming
increasingly popular in industry and in university curricula. An
experiment was run at North Carolina State University over a period
of one and a half years to assess the efficacy of pair programming
as an alternative educational technique in an introductory programming
course. We found that the retention rate of the students in the introductory
programming courses is equal to or better than that of the students
in the solo programming courses. Most students show a positive attitude
towards collaborative programming, and students in paired classes
continue to be successful in subsequent programming classes that
require solo programming. Pair programming also leads to a reduced
workload for the course staff in terms of grading, questions answered
and teaching effort.
