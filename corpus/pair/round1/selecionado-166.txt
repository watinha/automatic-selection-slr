An empirical study about the feelgood factor in pair programming
Why are programmer pairs more productive than single developers? Using
empirical data from two controlled experiments, we find that pair
performance is uncorrelated with programming experience, but shows
a significant correlation with how comfortably the developers feel
with pair programming during the session (the 'feelgood" factor).
