A cognitive model for solo programming and pair programming
As eXtreme programming (XP) has grown in popularity in both academia
and industry, pair programming, two programmers collaborating on
design, coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest.
Many researchers and practitioners remain skeptical of claims for
the productivity of pair programming. Three controlled experiments,
by Nosek, William, and Nawrocki, all reported statistical productivity
measurements, but the results were inconsistent and the differences
among the results could not be explained because there exists no
theoretical framework to articulate pair programming. This paper
proposes a cognitive model that describes the programming mechanism
and this in turn can be used to explain why and when a pair may outperform
two individuals. The model helps explain discrepancies in the results
of the above-mentioned experiments. To show how the proposed model
can be applied, a psychological experiment was conducted in which
twenty-two programmers who were informed only of the experiment and
the results of Nosek, and of the descriptions of Williams and Nawrocki,
were able to use our model to predict the possible outcomes of the
experiments of Williams and Nawrocki .
