Turning the knobs: a coaching pattern for XP through agile metrics
I want to turn the knobs to 10, but my job position doesn't allow
me to dictate that my team do so. Even if it did, forcing XP may
serve only to cause resentment and backlash. Though I've been learning
XP for over a year, it's still new to the rest of our team, and we're
used to our old habits. By giving team members control of how extreme
to be through a 'teaching survey', the team has started at a comfortable
level of XP and has opened the door to future extremes. We've used
the survey to define, coach, and track our XP process and have increased
our use of XP by 10% in three months.
