eXtreme Programming - helpful or harmful in educating undergraduates?
Criticism is sometimes leveled at the academic Software Engineering
community on the basis that current educational practices are too
document-centric. Both students and practitioners have suggested
that one of the popular, lighter-weight, agile methods would be a
better choice. This paper examines the educational goals for undergraduate
Software Engineering education and considers how they might be met
by the practices of eXtreme Programming. Our judgment is that education
about some agile practices could be beneficial for small-scale development.
However, as it stands now, eXtreme Programming as a package does
not lend itself for use in educating about large-scale system development
in tertiary education.
