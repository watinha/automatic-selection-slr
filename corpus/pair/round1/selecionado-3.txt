Evaluation of effects of pair work on quality of designs
Quality is a key issue in the development of software products. Although
the literature acknowledges the importance of the design phase of
software lifecycle and the effects of the design process and intermediate
products on the final product, little progress has been achieved
in addressing the quality of designs. This is partly due to difficulties
associated in defining quality attributes with precision and measurement
of the many different types and styles of design products, as well
as problems with assessing the methodologies utilized in the design
process. In this research we report on an empirical investigation
that we conducted to examine and evaluate quality attributes of design
products created through a process of pair-design and solo-design.
The process of pair-design methodology involves pair programming
principles where two people work together and periodically switch
between the roles of driver and navigator. The evaluation of the
quality of design products was based on ISO/IEC 9126 standards. Our
results show some mixed findings about the effects of pair work on
the quality of design products.
