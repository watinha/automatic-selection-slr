Introducing agile methods: three years of experience
The paper summarizes three years of experience of introducing agile  	practices in academic environments. The perceptions of students from  	four different academic programs (Diploma, Applied Bachelor's, Bachelor's  	and Master's) from two institutions are analyzed. Specifically, pair  	programming, test-driven development and project planning using the  	planning game were studied in detail. Overwhelmingly, students' experiences  	are positive and their opinions indicate the preference to continue  	to use agile practices if allowed. No major problems with agile techniques  	appeared in the evaluation contexts and benefits in these contexts  	have been seen.
