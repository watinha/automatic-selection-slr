Changing students' perceptions: an analysis of the supplementary
benefits of collaborative software development
Collaborative work has been in use as an instructional tool to increase
student understanding through collaborative learning and to improve
student performance in computer science courses. However, little
work has been done to understand how the act of collaboration, through
pair programming or group work, impacts a student's knowledge of
the benefits and difficulties of collaborative work experience in
collaborative work is essential preparation for professional software
development. A study was conducted at North Carolina State University
to assess changes in advanced undergraduate students' perceptions
of pair programming and collaboration. Student personality types,
learning styles, and other characteristics were gathered during two
semesters of an undergraduate software engineering course. The study
found that, after experiencing pair programming, most students indicated
a stronger preference to work with another student, believed that
pairing made them more organized, and believed that pairing saved
time on homework assignments. Students who disliked their collaborative
experiences were predominantly reflective learners, introverts, and
strong coders. Those students also cited that a non-participatory
partner and difficulties scheduling meeting times outside of the
classroom were primary reasons for disliking pair programming. Personality
type and learning style had little effect on the changes in perceptions
of collaboration.
