The Impact of educational background on design knowledge sharing
during pair programming: An empirical study
The management of knowledge in software processes is becoming a challenging
concern for researchers and practitioners, Explicit knowledge can
be formalized in many kinds of documents and rules, and consequently
transferred in a number of manners. On the contrary, tacit knowledge
cannot be formalized, because it is mainly retained in personal cognitive
models and consists of individual capabilities of dealing with problems.
The design of software systems requires a consistent deployment of
tacit knowledge, and pair programming has shown great promises for
helping to share knowledge between programmers. It is a common experience
that programmers come not only from computer science and engineering
curricula, but also from other education degrees, such as mathematics,
natural sciences, and social sciences. In this case they attend proper
specialist post graduation courses. We have executed an experiment
in order to verify the relationship between educational background
of pair's components and knowledge sharing throughout working in
pairs while designing software systems.
