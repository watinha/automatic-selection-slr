First year students' impressions of pair programming in CS1
Pair programming, as part of the Agile Development process, has noted  	benefits in professional software development scenarios. These successes  	have led to a rise in use of pair programming in educational settings,  	particularly in Computer Science 1 (CS1). Specifically, McDowell  	et al. [2006] has shown that students using pair programming in CS1  	do better in a CS2 class (with solo programming) than students who  	don't pair in CS1. This paper seeks to address a similar question,  	but from a qualitative, student-focused approach. How do students  	define, experience, and value the pair programming experience? How  	do they experience and value it compared to solo programming? Does  	pairing in CS1 impact their confidence in their abilities? We report  	on semi-structured interviews with 11 subjects from two institutions  	where pair programming was used in CS1, and solo programming was  	used in the CS2. Many of the responses met our expectations; students  	get stuck less and explore more ideas while pairing, and believe  	that pair programming helped them in CS1. Other responses were more  	surprising. Students reported that when solo programming they were  	more confident and understood their programs better. Many students  	also said that they started work on their assignments earlier when  	soloing. Students also continue to use other students as resources  	even when working solo.
