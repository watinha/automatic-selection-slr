Pair programming: addressing key process areas of the People-CMM
It has been long recognized that the quality of the people employed  	by a software organization is a major determinant of the quality  	of its products. Acknowledging the pivotal role played by people  	in software development, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI)  	devised the People - Capability Maturity Model. Like its software  	counterpart, the People CMM (P-CMM) defines five levels of maturity.  	An organization can achieve a level by institutionalizing the "best  	practices" for that level. The best practices are grouped together  	as Key Process Areas (KPAs). Pair programming is a practice in which  	two programmers work together at one computer on a single module  	of code designing, coding and testing it together. Evidence indicates  	that pair programming improves teamwork, communication and knowledge  	levels - all KPAs of the P-CMM. This paper establishes a link between  	pair programming and the KPAs defined in the P-CMM. Specifically,  	the paper provides an outline on the advantages and effects of adopting  	pair programming if an organization wants to achieve a higher P-CMM  	level.
