Modelling software development across time zones
Economic factors and the World Wide Web are turning software usage
and its development into global activities. Many benefits accrue
from global development not least from the opportunity to reduce
time-to-market through `around the clock' working. This paper identified
some of the factors and constraints that influence time-to-market
when software is developed across time zones. It describes a model
of the relationships between development time and the factors and
overheads associated with such a pattern of work. The paper also
reports on a small-scale empirical study of software development
across time zones and presents some lessons learned and conclusions
drawn from the theoretical and empirical work carried out.
