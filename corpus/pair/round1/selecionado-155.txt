Investigating pair-programming in a 2nd-year software development  	and design computer science course
This paper presents the results of a pair programming experiment conducted  	at the University of Auckland (NZ) during the first semester of 2004.  	It involved 300 second year computer science students attending a  	software design and construction course. We investigated similar  	issues to those reported by L. Williams et al., (2003) and employed  	a subset of the questionnaires used on the experiments presented.  	Our results support the use of pair programming as an effective programming/design  	learning technique.
