Supporting distributed extreme programming
Extreme programming (XP) is arguably improving the productivity of  	small, co-located software development teams. In this paper, we described  	an approach that tries to overcome the XP constraint of co-location  	by introducing a process-support environment (called MILOS for Agile  	Software Engineering-MILOS ASE) that helps software development teams  	to maintain XP practices in a distributed setting. MILOS ASE supports  	project coordination using the planning game, user stories, information  	routing, team communication, and pair programming.
