A Comparison of Pair Programming to Inspections for Software Defect
Reduction
Even though convinced of their efficacy, software development managers
are looking for ways to reduce the cost of inspections. Recent work
shows that inspections by two engineers have as good results as by
using a larger team of five. This indicates that pair programming
might be effective as an inspection technique, as other research
shows that a meeting is not necessarily better than not meeting.
An experiment was conducted to see if pair programming reduces defects
more than formal inspections. Results indicate that pair programming
is more effective. A defect rate of 9.6 per thousand lines of code,
much lower than that of a heavier method, were achieved. The implications
for teaching are explored.
