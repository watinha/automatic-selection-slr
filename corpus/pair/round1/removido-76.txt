An Initial Framework for Research on Pair Programming
In recent years, several claims have been put forward in favour of
pair programming, as opposed to individual programming. However,
results from existing studies on pair programming contain apparent
contradictions. The differences in the context in which the studies
were conducted may be one explanation for such results. The paper
presents an initial framework for research on pair programming. The
aim is to support empirical studies and meta-analysis for developing
theories about pair programming. The framework is based on: (1) existing
studies on pair programming, (2) ongoing studies by the authors,
and (3) theories from group dynamics.
