A Non-invasive Method for the Conformance Assessment of Pair Programming  	Practices Based on Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models
We specify a non-invasive method allowing to estimate the time each  	developer of a pair spends over the development activity, during  	Pair Programming. The method works by performing first a behavioural  	fingerprinting of each developer – based on low level event logs  	– which then is used to operate a segmentation over the log sequence  	produced by the pair: in a timelined log event sequence this is equivalent  	to estimating the times of the switching between developers. We model  	the individual developer’s behaviour by means of a Markov Chain –  	inferred from the logs – and model the developers’ role-switching  	process by a further, higher level, Markov Chain. The overall model  	consisting in the two nested Markov Chains belongs to the class of  	Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models. The method could be used not only  	to assess the degree of conformance with respect to predefined Pair  	Programming switch-times policies, but also to capture the characteristics  	of a given programmers pair’s switching process, namely in the context  	of Pair Programming effectiveness studies.
