Experiences with Pair programming at a Small College
Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers work side-by-side  	at one computer on the same program or problem. This paper discusses  	the use of pair programming in an introductory programming course  	at a small college and includes the results of a survey given to  	the students at the conclusion of the fall 2002 semester. The use  	of pair programming produces better projects in less time, and results  	in fewer assignments for the teaching staff to grade. Exam scores  	seem to be comparable with courses that do not allow students to  	program in pairs. Student evaluation of pair programming seems to  	be very positive; most students enjoy the class more when allowed  	to program in pairs and the group work promoted in the course teaches  	students important collaboration skills they will need in industry.  	The results discussed in this paper seem to suggest that pair programming  	is an effective teaching tool for introductory programming courses.
