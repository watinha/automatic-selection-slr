The pairing session as the atomic unit of work
We have an extreme programming team at a small company dedicated to
the agile approach. Our team of 7 developers decided to use the pairing
session as the fundamental unit of work for all organizing, planning,
estimating, tracking, and of course, pair programming. It's been
a great way to structure the day, provide rhythm and facilitate partner
swaps. Estimating and tracking in pairing sessions provides us concrete
feedback for improving estimates. This approach constitutes a hybrid
between real time and abstract-unit estimating, resulting in highly
effective planning and an extremely stable velocity. We have been
working this way for about a year and have been exceptionally pleased
with the results.
