A multiple case study on the impact of pair programming on product
quality
Pair programming is a programming technique in which two programmers
use one computer to work together on the same task. There is an ongoing
debate over the value of pair programming in software development.
The current body of knowledge in this area is scattered and unorganized.
Review shows that most of the results have been obtained from experimental
studies in university settings. Few, if any, empirical studies exist,
where pair programming has been systematically under scrutiny in
real software development projects. Thus, its proposed benefits remain
currently without solid empirical evidence. This paper reports results
from four software development projects where the impact of pair
programming on software product quality was studied. Our empirical
findings appear to offer contrasting results regarding some of the
claimed benefits of pair programming. They indicate that pair programming
may not necessarily provide as extensive quality benefits as suggested
in literature, and on the other hand, does not result in consistently
superior productivity when compared to solo programming.
