Modelling the Impact of a Learning Phase on the Business Value of
a Pair Programming Project
Pair programmers need a "warmup phase" before the pair can work at
full speed. The length of the learning interval varies, depending
on how experienced the developers are with pair programming and how
familiar they are with each other. We study how large the impact
of the lower pair productivity during warmup is on the business value
of the pair programming project. To this end, we extend our net present
value model for pair programming to explicitly include a learning
interval for pairs. We then carry out a simulation study where we
vary the shape of the learning curve, the length of the learning
interval, the final productivity level of the pairs, the market pressure,
and the size of the workforce. Our simulations show that the cost
of the warmup phase is reasonably small compared to the project value,
but nonetheless must be taken into account when estimating the project.
Our results also suggest that the learning overhead is not an obstacle
to introducing and using pair programming in a real environment.
