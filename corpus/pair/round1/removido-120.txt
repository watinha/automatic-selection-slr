Programming in pairs in high schools
Extreme programming (XP) is a new style of software development focusing
on excellent applications of programming techniques, clear communication,
and team work, which gives unimaginable results. A major practice
of extreme programming is pair programming. There are two programmers
working side by side at the same computer, collaborating on the same
analysis, the same design, implementation and test. Proponents of
pair programming argue that programs produced by pairs are of higher
quality, with less errors, better design than those produced by one
programmer. And they are made in the shortest time possible as well.
We think that pair programming model has also been found to be beneficial
for students. Initial quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate
that the use of pair programming in the computer science classroom
enhances student learning and satisfaction. We explore the nature
of pair programming, then examine the ways such a practise may enhance
teaching and learning in computer science education.
