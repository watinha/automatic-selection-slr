Work in progress-unexpected student outcome from collaborative agile
software development practices and paired programming in a software
engineering course
There has been low representation of women in computer science. This
paper describes the initial findings of a three-year research project
about women in the field of information technology. The goal of this
research is to examine the effect of pair programming and agile software
development on students. During the first semester of this project,
pair programming was used in a junior/senior software engineering
class at North Carolina State University. In this paper, we share
the grounded theory analysis of three interviews and thirteen project
retrospective essays of the female students. Theoretical models were
developed to describe: (a) the factors of students' enjoyment in
a software design course that employs agile software methods, (b)
context that influenced students' study habits, and (c) the effectiveness
of pair programming and agile methods. Initial findings indicate
that pair programming is an effective practice for the female students,
but it also brings new challenges for the instructors.
