Convincing the inconvincable
Despite the increasing knowledge base within the IT industry worldwide  	about the tremendous benefits of XP and agile processes, there is  	still a long way to go to convince a lot of developers. A side effect  	of this popularity is that XP practices may have a negative connotation  	for some. This may result in a reluctance to try or adopt any of  	these practices. This paper describes some strategies that may be  	employed by project team members to help those that seem "inconvincible"  	to recognise some of the benefits of XP. Introducing XP should be  	an evolution not a revolution.
