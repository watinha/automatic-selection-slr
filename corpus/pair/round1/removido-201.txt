Collaborative design using a shared object spaces infrastructure
A collaborative design system strongly depends on the chosen collaboration
methodology, as well as on its technological infrastructure. This
article describes the implementation of collaborative service based
on shared object spaces as technological infrastructure and its methodology
is based on pair programming. This service is to be incorporated
in a distributed collaborative environment called Cave. The collaboration
service implementation presented in this work allows collaboration
among designers through a data depository. This service is validated
with a diagram editor that is used as case study.
