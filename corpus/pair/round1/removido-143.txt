Influence of codified knowledge on software design task performance:  	A comparison of pairs with individuals
The need to improve the success rates of software development projects  	has prompted the software engineering community to come-up with various  	initiatives. These initiatives include: new software development  	processes such as Extreme Programming (XP), leveraging the development  	process by reusing existing knowledge of software artifacts. XP utilizes  	pairs in the performance of various software development tasks. Moreover,  	development of software applications is a knowledge intensive process  	that utilizes both tacit and explicit knowledge. This experimental  	study utilized software development professionals as subjects and  	manipulated the iv mode of participation (individual or pairs) and  	availability of codified knowledge (design patterns). Results of  	the study indicate that the performance of collaborating pairs were  	better than the 2nd best individual in nominal pairs. Collaborating  	pairs also took more time than the average time taken by nominal  	pairs to complete the task and they were more satisfied than the  	individuals. This study also found that the codified knowledge in  	the form of design patterns helped in arriving at a better solution.  	One interesting finding of this study is the effect of design self-efficacy/collective-efficacy  	on task performance.
