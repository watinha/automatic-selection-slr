How to steer an embedded software project: tactics for selecting
the software process model
Modern large new product developments (NPD) are typically characterized
by many uncertainties and frequent changes. Often the embedded software
development projects working on such products face many problems
compared to traditional, placid project environments. One of the
major project management decisions is then the selection of the project's
software process model. An appropriate process model helps coping
with the challenges, and prevents many potential project problems.
On the other hand, an unsuitable process choice causes additional
problems. This paper investigates the software process model selection
in the context of large market-driven embedded software product development
for new telecommunications equipment. Based on a quasi-formal comparison
of publicly known software process models including modern agile
methodologies, we propose a process model selection frame, which
the project manager can use as a systematic guide for (re)choosing
the project's process model. A novel feature of this comparative
selection model is that we make the comparison against typical software
project problem issues. Some real-life project case examples are
examined against this model. The selection matrix expresses how different
process models answer to different questions, and indeed there is
not a single process model that would answer all the questions. On
the contrary, some of the seeds to the project problems are in the
process models themselves. However, being conscious of these problems
and pitfalls when steering a project enables the project manager
to master the situation.
