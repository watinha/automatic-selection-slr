Debunking the nerd stereotype with pair programming
Our studies show that using pair programming as a structure for incorporating
collaboration in the classroom helps increase and broaden participation
in computing fields and helps debunk the myth that programmers work
alone all the time. It's also a way for students to get a better
view of and feel more confident in their preparation for working
in the real world. The face of the IT workforce is changing. As the
millennial generation makes its way into the working world, the archetype
of the nerd as the introverted, obsessed computer programmer must
share equal space with the chatty, social software engineer.
