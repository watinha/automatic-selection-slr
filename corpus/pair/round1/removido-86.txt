Student performance in CS1 with distributed pair programming
Pair programming has been shown to provide many pedagogical benefits,  	particularly for students who are learning to program. One drawback  	with pair programming is its collocation requirement, which makes  	it difficult for some students to enjoy these benefits. We report  	on an experiment with a tool that allows students to pair program  	from separate locations. Our results indicate that students who experience  	the increased flexibility of distributed pairing perform as well  	in their introductory programming course as students who have to  	physically meet in order to pair. These students are also as confident  	as the collocated students. We also confirm earlier results reported  	by others that pair programming results in greater student confidence  	and increased student performance.
