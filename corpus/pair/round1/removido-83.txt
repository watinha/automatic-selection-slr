"Extreme programming" - extreme programming or extreme revisionism?
Outlines the software programming problems considered in the relevant  	April 1987 IEEE paper. Details the fundamental activities of extended  	programming to cope with them: code writing; testing; listening to/observing  	the market; and the actual process of design.. Breaks down the basic  	steps of the XP process and emphasises the novel and important aspect  	of pair programming. Compares the cost/time curves, the programming  	time, the error rate and number of instructions required in pair-programming  	as opposed to single-programming. Suggests that the XP process may  	fail to provide the software 'silver bullet' because of its inability  	to take account of individual requirements.
