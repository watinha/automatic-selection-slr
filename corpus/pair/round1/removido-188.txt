Experiences with pair and tri programming in a second level course
In this paper we describe our experiences with multi-programming (pair
and tri programming) in a second level course. The course, "Application
Software Development" is a second year course, which has a heavy
emphasis on Java programming in the labs as well as the development
of a full-fledged project. The objective of the course is to build
an entire project that comprises of various software engineering
activities that span across the semester. In general, we observe
that multi-programming improves the students' ability in analytical
thinking and communicating the conceptual ideas. It also raises certain
issues when this approach is adopted in the educational context.
In this paper we discuss some of these issues. Overall, multi-programming
experience has been a rewarding experience for the students in spite
of certain problems that were encountered .
