Student-based pair programming: an examination
This paper examines the retention and learning of unfamiliar material  	to undergraduate students through the use of pair programming. Students  	in a networking class were asked to develop software applications  	together in the hope that each student would learn more and develop  	better applications. A survey was then distributed to assess the  	outcome and analyze the results.
