Conflict in Collaborative Software Development
Pair Programming is an innovative collaborative software development  	methodology. Anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests that this  	agile development method produces better quality software in reduced  	time with higher levels of developer satisfaction. To date, little  	explanation has been offered as to why these improved performance  	outcomes occur. In this qualitative study, we focus on how individual  	differences, and specifically task conflict, impact results of the  	collaborative software development process and related outcomes.  	We illustrate that low to moderate levels of task conflict actually  	enhance performance, while high levels mitigate otherwise anticipated  	positive results.
