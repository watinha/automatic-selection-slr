Support for distributed pair programming in the transparent video
facetop
The transparent video facetop is a user interface concept that supports
not only single-user interactions with a PC, but also close pair
collaborations, such as that found in collaborative Web browsing,
remote medicine, and in distributed pair programming. In this paper
we discuss the use of a video-based UI called the facetop (Stotts
et al., 2004) for solving several problems reported to us by teams
doing distributed pair programming. Specifically, the facetop allows
a distributed pair to recapture some the facial expressions and face-to-face
communications contact lost in earlier distributed sessions. It also
allows members of a distributed pair to point conveniently, quickly,
and naturally to their shared work, in the same manner (manually)
that they do when seated side-by-side. Our results enhance the ability
of organizations to do effective XP-style agile development with
distributed teams.
