Task complexity and effectiveness of pair programming: An experimental
study
Extreme Programming, which is recently gaining popularity as an alternate
software development methodology, involves two programmers working
collaboratively to develop software. This study examined the efficacy
of pair programming by comparing the effectiveness of collaborating
pairs with those of programmers working individually. Student subjects
participated in a controlled laboratory experiment. Two factors were
manipulated in the experiment: programming task complexity (high
vs. low) and programmers working individually vs. in pairs. The performance
of programmer pairs was compared with those of the best performer
and the second best performer from among nominal pairs. An important
finding of the study is that programmer pairs outperform second best
programmers in nominal groups, but perform at comparable levels as
the best programmers in nominal groups. The best programmers among
collaborating pairs also develop significantly better understanding
of the problem domain, reflected in their task mental model, compared
to the second-best individuals working individually in nominal pairs.
Their mental models were however comparable to that of the best programmers
in the nominal groups. These two relationships were found to be consistent
across different levels of task complexity. In terms of perceptual
outcomes, the best programmers among the collaborating pairs have
comparable levels of overall satisfaction as the best and second-best
individuals in the nominal groups, while second-best programmers
among collaborating pairs have higher satisfaction than the best
and second-best individuals in the nominal pairs. An additional finding
was that best programmers among the collaborating pairs have higher
confidence in their solution than best programmers in nominal pair
when task complexity is low, but not when it is high.
