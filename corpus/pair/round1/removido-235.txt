Extreme programming: Pair-programmers, team players or future leaders?
This paper will establish that a productive working relationship can
be enhanced in an Extreme Programming (XP) Pair-Programming Team
if Team members here were to develop and improve their own individual
Emotional Intelligence (EI) persona. A conceptual model (ARMES) was
developed for personal traits identified for Pair-Programmers. The
validity of this ARMES model for Pair-Programming was tested against
two (previously published) XP Case Studies. Finally, implications
of the conclusions were discussed along with suggested areas of future
research.
