How to get the most out of extreme programming/agile methods
This paper reports the results of an analysis of thirty-one extreme
programming (XP)/agile methods early adopter projects completed by
fourteen firms who have embraced the techniques in the form of lessons
learned. The survey results show that early adopters have cut costs,
improved productivity and reduced time to market through the use
of these methods. To get the most from these methods, fifteen lessons
learned have been developed that build on the experiences of others.
Several of these lessons run counter to the teachings of the methodology
developers. The paper next provides a scorecard that rates XP's performance
in eight application domains. The paper concludes by summarizing
four critical success factors for early adopters.
