In Support of Pair Programming in the Introductory Computer Science  	Course
A formal pair programming experiment was run at North Carolina to  	empirically assess the educational efficacy of the technique in a  	CS1 course. Results indicate that students who practice pair programming  	perform better on programming projects and are more likely to succeed  	by completing the class with a C or better. Student pairs are more  	self-sufficient which reduces their reliance on the teaching staff.  	Qualitatively, paired students demonstrate higher order thinking  	skills than students who work alone. These results are supportive  	of pair programming as a collaborative learning technique.
