Factors affecting the perceived effectiveness of pair programming  	in higher education
This paper reports the findings of a study conducted on postgraduate  	students of an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course in which  	pair programming was applied as an educational technique. This study  	addressed the question Why is pair programming sometimes ineffective?  	The focus of the study was on exploring the factors that may affect  	the success of pair programming. We employed a combination of data  	gathering techniques and triangulated them to analyze the data. We  	observed, recorded and interviewed students who pair programmed.  	They also completed questionnaires. There was evidence that matching  	by skill level and the task in hand are the main factors in the success  	of a pair programming session.
