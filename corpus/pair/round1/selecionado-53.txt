Pair Programming and Pair trading:Effects on Learning and motivation
in a CS2 courses
Pair programming is a seemingly powerful addition to the tool kit
of educators wishing to enhance learning in software engineering
students. This technique, found among professional software development
practices associated with extreme programming (Beck), has probably
existed informally for some time in various forms of collaborative
software development. More recently pair programming has been formalized
and used as an intentional pedagogical tool in the classroom. During
the Spring semester of 2002, the author implemented a multi-phase
project in CS2 similar to the one described by Newhall and Meeden
(2002). The author used pair-programming and pair-trading to facilitate
the production of high quality code. Qualitative data were collected
from the students throughout the project. This paper documents the
qualitative study and sheds some light on why pair programming can
be successful in educational applications, and also how pair programmers
can be assessed.
