Agile software development: human values and culture
Software engineers need to know how to evaluate different methods
of developing software. A group of new development methods have emerged
under the general label "agile development." These techniques are
sometimes called "light weight" as opposed to "heavy weight" techniques
such as those based on the waterfall model. Two classic ethical techniques
- utilitarian and deontological analyses - can offer insights into
the arguments surrounding, agile methods. These and other applied
ethics techniques offer software engineers a more precise language
for articulating their ideas about software engineering issues that
involve human values.
