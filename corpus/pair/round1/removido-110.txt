Extreme programming and its development practices
Extreme programming (XP) has attracted attention because of its fierce
denial of many well-accepted software engineering practices considered
as a sound approach to the development of intensive software systems.
XP has been declared to be a new way of software development: a lightweight
methodology, which is efficient, low-risk, flexible, predictable,
scientific, and distinguishable from any other methodology. In the
core of XP practices are programming activities, with strong emphasis
on oral communications, automated tests, pair programming, storytelling
culture and collective code-ownership at any time in the XP project.
The paper gives an overview of XP practices and raises some serious
concerns regarding their role in conceptual modelling and code generation;
which directly affects software architecture solutions. The paper
also tackles similarities between rational unified process (RUP)
and XP, which have often been juxtaposed by software developers.
