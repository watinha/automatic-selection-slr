Examining the Compatibility of Student Pair Programmers
Pair programming has been shown to be beneficial for both students  	and teaching staff in university courses. A two-phased study of 1350  	students was conducted at North Carolina State University from 2002-2005  	to determine if teaching staff can proactively form compatible pairs  	based upon any of the following factors: personality type, learning  	style, skill level, programming self esteem, work ethic, or time  	management preference. We examined compatibility among freshmen,  	advanced undergraduate and graduate student pair programmers. We  	have found that overall 93% of students are compatible with their  	partners. Students notably preferred to pair with a partner that  	he or she perceived to be of similar or higher skill level to them,  	which can be predicted by grouping students with similar grade point  	average. Additionally, pairs comprised of a sensor and an intuitor  	learning style seem to be compatible, and pairs with differing work  	ethic are generally not compatible.
