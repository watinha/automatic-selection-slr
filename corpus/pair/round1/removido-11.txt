Software process improvement with agile practices in a large telecom  	company
Besides the promise of rapid and efficient software development, agile  	methods are well-appreciated for boosting communication and motivation  	of development teams. However, they are not practical "as such" in  	large organizations, especially because of the well-established,  	rigid processes in the organizations. In this paper, we present a  	case study where a few agile practices were injected into the software  	process of a large organization in order to pilot pair programming  	and improve the motivation and competence build-up. The selected  	agile practices were pair programming, the planning game and collective  	code ownership. We show how we adjust these practices in order to  	integrate them into the existing software process of the company  	in the context of a real software project.
