Implementing Virtual Pair Programming in E-Learning Environment
Programming subjects are one of the core and important subjects that  	should be taken by students majoring in Information System or computing.  	The problem of teaching and learning of programming has been widely  	reported in literatures. Many attempts have been made to solve this  	problems and this had led to many new approaches in teaching and  	learning of programming. One of the approach that has been proposed  	is the use of pair-programming, which is one of the practice of eXtreme  	Programming (XP). The advent of e-learning has given birth of Virtual  	Pair Programming (VPP). This paper describes how asynchronous mode  	of collaboration using VPP could be implemented for e-learning learners  	to learn programming.
