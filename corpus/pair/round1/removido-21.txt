Guidelines for the use of pair programming in a freshman programming  	class
Undergraduate freshman programming classes are conventionally organized  	such that individual students complete a set of concept-specific  	and unrelated programming assignments. This structure does not prepare  	students for future collaborative efforts or for the future use of  	software engineering practices. The addition of pair programming  	into a freshman programming class at the University of California  	at Santa Cruz (UCSC) showed similar benefits to similar studies on  	upper-division software classes, and is expected to show an improvement  	in students' willingness and ability to participate in complex, collaborative  	software engineering assignments in later classes. This paper describes  	the implementation of the pair programming experiment at UCSC, discusses  	some of the issues that compromised the effectiveness of certain  	pairs, and provides implementation guidelines for avoiding such issues  	in other classes
