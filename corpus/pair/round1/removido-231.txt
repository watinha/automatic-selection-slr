Improving the interface between business and product development
using agile practices and the cycles of control framework
We describe how we created and adopted an agile product development
process in a small software company based on the cycles of control
framework by combining selected agile practices and principles from
the scrum and XP methodologies. Describing the development process
using the framework helped in identifying the crucial control points
between business and development and enabled defining practical and
well-functioning connections between them. The control points enable
visibility and flexible management of product development status
and direction. Currently business understands development status
better, which has led to fewer interruptions between the control
points, and thus improved working conditions for development. Positive
experiences are reported of newly adopted practices such as scrum
meetings, pair programming, and unit testing. However, finding and
adopting technical tools to facilitate the process proved to be challenging.
