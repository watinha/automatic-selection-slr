Heterogeneous and homogenous pairs in pair programming: an empirical
analysis
Extreme programming (XP) is causing a lot of hype currently. Pair
programming is one of its practices, where two programmers work collaboratively
at one computer on the same design, algorithm, code, or test. The
purpose of this technique is to produce higher quality code in less
time. The collaborative working of two brains is better than one
as long as both are actively trying to accomplish the same goal.
It depends on many things, such as creativity, productivity and brainstorming
which are the essential factors of the programming activity. The
existence of these factors can vary in homogenous and heterogeneous
pairs, so the functional brainstorming capability of different pairs
during programming may vary in terms of quality, accuracy and speed.
This paper presents the empirical analysis between the homogenous
and heterogeneous pairs in terms of efficiency, accuracy, quality,
quantity of bugs, brainstorming performance and creativity potential
during programming activity.
