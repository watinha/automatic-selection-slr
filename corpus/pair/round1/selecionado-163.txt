A preliminary study on the impact of a pair design phase on pair
programming and solo programming
The drawback of pair programming is the nearly doubled personnel cost.
The extra cost of pair programming originates from the strict rule
of extreme programming where every line of code should be developed
by a pair of developers. Is this rule not a waste of resources? Is
it not possible to gain a large portion of the benefits of pair programming
by only a small fraction of the meeting time of a pair programming
session? We conducted a preliminary study to answer this question
by splitting the pair programming process into a pair design and
a pair implementation phase. The pair implementation phase is compared
to a solo implementation phase, which in turn was preceeded by a
pair design phase, as well. The study is preliminary as its major
goal was to identify an appropriate sample size for subsequent experiments.
The data from this study suggest that there is no difference in terms
of development cost between a pair and a solo implementation phase
if the cost for developing programs of similar level of correctness
is concerned. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
