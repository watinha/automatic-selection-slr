A replicated experiment of pair-programming in a 2nd-year software
development and design computer science course
This paper presents the results of a replicated pair programming experiment
conducted at the University of Auckland (NZ) during the first semester
of 2005. It involved 190 second year Computer Science students attending
a software design and construction course. We replicated the experiment
described by Mendes et al. (2005), investigating similar issues to
those reported Williams et al. (2003) and employing a subset of the
questionnaires used by Williams et al. Our results confirm the use
of pair programming as an effective programming/design learning technique.
