Pair Design in Undergraduate Labs
Pair programming is widely recognized as a successful method of improving
student competence in computer science while lowering dependence
on teaching staff. In this paper, we propose an approach based on
pair programming, termed pair design, that reinforces program design
and testing skills in addition to collaboration. We describe the
approach and our results in applying it to freshmen and sophomore
laboratory environments.
