Working in pairs as a means for design knowledge building: An Empirical
Study
Pair programming is increasingly attracting researchers' and practitioners'
attention. One of the claimed benefits of pair programming consists
of easing socialization among programmers, with the effect of transferring
tacit knowledge. Designing software systems requires a strong employment
of tacit knowledge, such as individual experience and skills. In
this paper, the authors, explore the hypothesis that working in pairs
can speed up and enforce the knowledge building process among designers.
We name "pair designing" the application of pair programming concepts
to the design stage. An experiment has been performed to test the
effect of pair designing on knowledge building. This paper discusses
preliminary results, which confirm the hypothesis of a positive effect
of working in pairs on the process of knowledge building.
