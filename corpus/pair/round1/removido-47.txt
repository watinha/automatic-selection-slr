Interruptions on Software Teams: A Comparison of Paired and Solo
Programmers
This study explores interruption patterns among software developers
who program in pairs versus those who program solo. Ethnographic
observations indicate that interruption length, content, type, occurrence
time, and interrupter and interruptee strategies differed markedly
for radically collocated pair programmers versus the programmers
who primarily worked alone. After presenting an analysis of 242 interruptions
drawn from more than 40 hours of observation data, we discuss how
team configuration and work setting influenced how and when developers
handled interruptions. We then suggest ways that CSCW systems might
better support pair programming and, more broadly, provide interruption-handling
support for workers in knowledge-intensive occupations.
