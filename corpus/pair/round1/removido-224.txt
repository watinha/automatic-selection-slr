Rate-based software reliability process simulation
Rate-based software reliability process simulation treats software  	development processes as stochastic processes controlled by rate  	functions. It's the natural expansion of the traditional analytical  	software reliability models. This simulation technique can be used  	to predict the software reliability in the early stages of development  	process and simulate many development processes with different characteristics  	by constructing corresponding rate functions. This paper explains  	the mathematic founding of the rate-based software reliability process  	simulation and presents realization approaches of single event process  	simulation and multi-event process simulation. This paper also presents  	an application which has simulated the influence of two development  	methods, competitive design and pair programming, to the software  	reliability by using Softrel.
