Is external code quality correlated with programming experience or
feelgood factor?
This paper is inspired by an article by Muller and Padberg who study
the feelgood factor and programming experience, as candidate drivers
for the pair programming performance. We not only reveal a possible
threat to validity of empirical results presented by Muller and Padberg
but also perform an independent research. Our objective is to provide
empirical evidence whether external code quality is correlated with
the feelgood factor, or with programming experience. Our empirical
study is based on a controlled experiment with MSc students. It appeared
that the external code quality is correlated with the feelgood factor,
and programming experience, in the case of pairs using a classic
(test-last) testing approach. The generalization of the results is
limited due to the fact that MSc students participated in the study.
The research revealed that both the feelgood factor and programming
experience may be the external code quality drivers.
