Distributed Pair Programming on the Web
Pair programming is an extreme programming practice, where two programmers
working sided by side on a single computer produce a software artifact.
This technique has demonstrated to produce higher quality code in
less time it would take an individual programmer. We present the
COPPER system, a synchronous source code editor that allows two distributed
software engineers to write a program using pair programming. COPPER
implements characteristics of groupware systems such as communication
mechanism, collaboration awareness, concurrency control, and a radar
view of the documents, among others. It also incorporates a document
presence module, which extends the functionality of instant messaging
systems to allow users to register documents from a Web server and
interact with them in a similar fashion as they do with a colleague.
We report results from a preliminary evaluation of COPPER which provide
evidence that the system could successfully support distributed pair
programming.
