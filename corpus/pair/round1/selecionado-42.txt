Critical Personality Traits in Successful Pair Programming
Pair programming (PP) is a common practice in Extreme programming,
in which two programmers work together using a single computer. The
close interaction required by PP makes it difficult to apply. The
hypothesis is that certain personality traits are crucial for the
success of PP, and PP partners should be chosen based on these personality
traits. In this research, we first survey the programmers in industry
to identify the perceived important personality traits for PP, and
then conduct experiments to determine the significance of these personality
traits in successful PP.
