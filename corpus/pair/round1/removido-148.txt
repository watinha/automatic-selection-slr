Pair programming improves student retention, confidence, and program
quality
A study was conducted to investigate the effects of pair programming
on student performance and subsequent pursuit of computer science-related
degrees among both female and male college students taking an introductory
programming course designed for computer science-related majors.
The study provides some of the most compelling evidence to date of
the effectiveness of pair programming as a pedagogical tool. Pairing
was found to bolster course completion and consequently course pass
rates, and contribute to greater persistence in computer science-related
majors. Students who paired were more likely to pass the subsequent
programming course that required them to work alone. This is a strong
indication that pairing did not result in a significant number of
students passing the course without learning how to program due to
a "free ride" from their partner. The pairing students also produce
higher quality programs, are more confident in their work, and enjoy
it more.
