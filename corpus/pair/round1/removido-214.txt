Adapting Extreme Programming for a core Software Engineering Course
Over a decade ago, the manufacturing industry determined it needed
to be more agile to

thrive and prosper in a changing, nonlinear, uncertain and unpredictable
business environment. Recently, the software engineering community
has come to the same realization. A group of software methodologists
has created a set of software development processes, termed agile
methodologies that have been specifically designed to respond to
the demands of the turbulent software industry. Each of the processes
in the set of agile processes is comprised of a set of practices.
As educators, we must assess the emerging agile practices, integrate
them into our courses (carefully), and share our experiences and
results from doing so. This paper discusses the use of Extreme Programming,
a popular agile methodology, in a senior Software Engineering course
at North Carolina State University. It then provides recommendations
for integrating

agile principles into a core Software Engineering course.
