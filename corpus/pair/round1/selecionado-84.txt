Problems encountered by novice pair programmers
In a study of the types of problems encountered by students that led
them to seek assistance, Robins et al. [2006] found that the most
common problems were related to trivial mechanics. The students in
this study worked by themselves on their programming exercises. This
article discusses a replication of the Robins et al. study in which
the subjects pair programmed. The types of problems encountered by
the pairing students were similar to those of the solo students.
The number of problems requiring assistance was much smaller for
the pairing students, which suggests that they were able to resolve
more problems on their own.
