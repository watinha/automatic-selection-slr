When Pairs Disagree, 1-2-3
Pair programming requires two programmers to work together to solve  	the same problem. These programmers probably have opinions about  	most design decisions (method names, and anything else that comes  	up during a pairing session). Some of those opinions are stronger  	than others. It is quite likely that those opinions will differ,  	sometimes often. When they do, there needs to be a simple way to  	resolve the conflict. Arguing doesn't work, and helps no one. When  	a disagreement about how to proceed comes up, each pair should score  	his opinion on a scale of 1-3. The highest score dictates what the  	pair does next. In the event of a tie, the pair should discuss the  	various options, agree to disagree, pick one, and move on. This simple  	approach works.
