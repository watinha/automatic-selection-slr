How good are agile methods?
The software industry seems to be embracing yet another change to  	the way it does business. Because of their emphasis on agility and  	time-to-market, many programming shops are moving to agile methods.  	Unlike more traditional approaches, these methods focus on generating  	early releases of working products using mostly collaborative techniques  	such as pair programming, refactoring, and having customers work  	on site as team members. Programmers use these releases-which are  	working products, not prototypes-to demonstrate features and functions  	to stakeholders involved in their use, marketing, and support. This  	article surveys the experience software engineers in a wide, range  	of industries have had in deploying agile methods.
