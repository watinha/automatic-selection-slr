Distributed pair programming: an empirical study
Pair programming provides many benefits, both to the programmers and  	to the product that they develop. However, pair programming is limited  	to those situations in which the developers can collocate, preventing  	its benefits from being enjoyed by the widest possible audience.  	A software tool that allowed the pair to work from separate locations  	would address this limitation. This paper presents some initial results  	from a distributed pair programming experiment in which students  	in an introductory programming class used such a tool. Student perceptions  	of distributed pair programming are also discussed.
