Increased Retention of Early Computer Science and Software Engineering  	Students Using Pair Programming
An important problem faced by many Computer Science and Software Engineering  	programs is declining enrollment. In an effort to reverse that trend  	at Mississippi State University, we have instituted pair programming  	for the laboratory exercises in the introductory programming course.  	This paper describes a study performed to analyze whether using pair  	programming would increase retention. An important goal of this study  	was not only to measure increased retention, but to provide insight  	into why retention increased or decreased. The results of the study  	showed that retention significantly increased for those students  	already majoring in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Computer  	Engineering. In addition, survey results indicated that the students  	viewed many aspects of pair programming to be very beneficial to  	their learning experience.
