Experiences with a Case Study on Pair Programming
Agile methods are becoming more and more popular. Most well known  	among them is probably Extreme Programming (XP) [2]. One key practice  	of XP is Pair Programming (PP), where two developers work simultaneously  	on a programming task. However, despite their popularity, few is  	known about limitations of these methods in terms of empirical knowledge.  	Some empirical studies exist on Pair Programming [5][8]. These studies  	compared PP to solo programming and were conducted for small, isolated  	tasks. In this paper, we describe a case study conducted in the context  	of a more realistic task within a university practical course, conducted  	in teams of six students and comprising about 700 person-hours of  	total effort. Within our case study setting, we were able to find  	weak support for the results achieved in earlier studies. More importantly,  	we describe experiences we made in conducting the case study and  	suggest improvements for future investigations.
