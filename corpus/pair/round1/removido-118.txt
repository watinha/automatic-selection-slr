The Effect of Human Memory Organization on Code Reviews under Different
Single and Pair Code Reviewing Scenarios
Human memory organization has been shown to be related to how programmers
understand programs. In recent years, agile methods brought the emphasis
back on human and social aspects of software engineering with a set
of new principles and practices. One of them, pair programming has
been shown to improve quality and reduce the development costs. In
this position paper, we propose a controlled experiment to evaluate
the effect of human memory organization through chunking on code
reviews under different single and pair code reviewing scenarios.
