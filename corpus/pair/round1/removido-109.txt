Extreme programming: a more musical approach to software development?
This paper considers the relationship between software development
as it is typically practiced, the extreme programming methodology
and the learning and working environment of those involved in a creative
art - music. In particular we emphasise how pair programming can
facilitate an increase in the overall skill level of individuals
and teams, and relate this to musicians' development of models of
excellence through ensemble playing. Consideration is also given
to the psychology of music performance and its relevance to the pursuit
of excellence in software development.
