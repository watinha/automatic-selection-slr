All I really need to know about pair programming I learned in kindergarten
Pair programming is a practice in which two programmers work side-by-side
at one computer, continuously collaborating on the same design, algorithm,
code or test. This method has been demonstrated to improve productivity
and the quality of software products. When it comes to programming
practices, studies show two heads are almost always better than one.
Programmers are universally more confident in their solutions when
programming in pairs as opposed to working alone. Likewise, most
of them enjoy their jobs more when pair programming. However, most
programmers are long conditioned to working alone and often resist
the transition to pair programming. Ultimately, most make this transition
with great success. The goal of this article is to help programmers
become effective pair programmers. The transition to and on-going
success as a pair programmer often involves practicing everyday civility.
In this article we explore the inherent lessons related to successful
pair programming.
