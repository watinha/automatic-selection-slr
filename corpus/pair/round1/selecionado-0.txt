Work in progress - effect of instructional design and pair programming
on student performance in an introductory programming course
California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) uses an outcomes-based
delivery philosophy and focuses on measurable student learning. Because
of the required outcome it was determined that the students needed
more scaffolding or "metacognitive support" than is typically afforded
in the introductory programming courses. The students were simply
not capable of making the jump from simple programming concepts to
being able to deliver a satisfactory completed portfolio piece. This
paper reports on a study that investigated use of pair programming
as a delivery methodology for an introductory Java programming course.
