A system for teaching web engineering concepts in a supervised way using rich internet applications
In the past, different methodologies have been proposed to systematise web development processes. Some of them are supported by Computer Aided Software Engineering {(CASE)} tools that help the user in all or part of the phases of application development. A number of these tools are used with the didactic aim of teaching the development process of web applications. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the currently available {CASE} tools neither support the online cooperative design nor allow the modelling of a process with the supervision of a teacher. In this paper, we present a system for teaching web engineering concepts based on Rich Internet Applications {(RIAs),} i.e., web applications with multimedia, high levels of interactivity and collaborative work support. The proposed tool allows different modellers to design web applications in a cooperative and supervised way, as well as automatically generate its code.
