Engineering rich internet applications with a model-driven approach
Rich Internet Applications {(RIAs)} have introduced powerful novel functionalities into the Web architecture, borrowed from client-server and desktop applications. The resulting platforms allow designers to improve the user's experience, by exploiting client-side data and computation, bidirectional client-server communication, synchronous and asynchronous events, and rich interface widgets. However, the rapid evolution of {RIA} technologies challenges the {Model-Driven} Development methodologies that have been successfully applied in the past decade to traditional Web solutions. This paper illustrates an evolutionary approach for incorporating a wealth of {RIA} features into an existing Web engineering methodology and notation. The experience demonstrates that it is possible to model {RIA} application requirements at a high-level using a platform-independent notation, and generate the client-side and server-side code automatically. The resulting approach is evaluated in terms of expressive power, ease of use, and implementability.
