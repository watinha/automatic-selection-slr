A service re-design methodology for multi-channel adaptation
Many available services have been designed for a single-channel world, Web and Internet typically. In a real world scenario, an ever-growing number of users take advantage of different kinds of communication channels and devices. In this paper, we propose a methodology to formalize the re-design process of these services to support multi-channel access in different contexts. The methodology considers the channel characteristics, the location of users and the context of use to characterize the new services. It has been tested in a case study: the Italian National Project of Identification and Registration of Bovine Animals.
