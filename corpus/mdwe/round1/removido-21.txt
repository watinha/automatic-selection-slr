A {Model-Driven} Reverse Engineering Approach for Semantic Web Services Composition
Web service technologies are becoming increasingly important for integrating service-oriented applications. The Web services reverse engineering process becomes necessary in order to facilitate the reuse and composition of Web services. This paper describes a model driven Web service reverse engineering process, where Web service descriptions {(WSDL)} are transformed to {UML} models, then the generated {UML} models are integrated into composite Web services, finally the new Web service descriptions {(OWL)} are generated
