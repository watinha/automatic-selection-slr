Functional web applications
Web applications are complex software artefacts whose creation and maintenance is not feasible without abstractions, or models. Many special-purpose languages are used today as notations for these models. We show that functional programming languages can be used as modelling languages, offering substantial benefits. The precision and expressive power of functional languages helps in developing concise and maintainable specifications. We demonstrate our approach with the help of a simple example web site, using Haskell as the implementation language.
