The {UM-MAIS} Methodology for Multi-channel Adaptive Web Information Systems
Multichannel Adaptive Web Information Systems {(WISs)} are emerging as a new class of information systems, characterized by their powerful use of mobility and context-awareness. Different methodologies have been proposed so far for the analysis and design of Multichannel Adaptive {WISs,} specifically focused on the front-end layer or the back-end layer, but no methodology has aimed to cover all the lifecycle and to design all the components that characterize Multichannel Adaptive {WIS.} This paper fills such a gap, by presenting {UM-MAIS} {(Unified} Methodology for Multichannel Adaptive Information Systems), a new methodology that capitalizes on well-established existing methods. It supports the analysis and design of the various components of Multichannel Adaptive {WISs} (including the user's experience) in a comprehensive and unified manner with special emphasis on context modeling, personalization, and adaptation.
