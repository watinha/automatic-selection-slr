Specification of personalization in web application design
Personalization of websites has become an important issue in Web modeling methods due to their big and heterogeneous audience. However, due to the existence of too many notations to represent the same design concepts in different methodologies, personalization specifications cannot be used out of the scope of a single tool or method. Moreover, in some cases, personalization is not defined as a separate aspect, being difficult to maintain and update. This paper tackles the aforementioned problems presenting a generic modeling technique to facilitate the specification of the personalization. Personalization specifications can be reused across different websites and different development environments.
