Surveying navigation modelling approaches
Recently, a number of authors who work on web application modelling have paid attention to the ideas regarding separation of concerns that underlie aspect-orientation, as well as some ideas that come from the model-driven development community. They attempt to improve the representation and separation of some concerns such as customisation or navigational concerns that are scattered throughout different software artifacts and tangled with other concerns in order to give a best support to the evolution of web applications. This paper surveys recent proposals in this field and compares them within a homogeneous framework that bridges the gap between the many different terminologies used, and highlights open problems that need further research.
