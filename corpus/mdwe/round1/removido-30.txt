Conceptual modeling of service composition using aggregation and specialization relationships
Web service development and composition are mainly realized using programming languages. The high demand of productivity in the development of composite Web service requires different approaches. Conceptual modeling could be a solution. In this work we present an approach to conceptual modeling of Web service composition. Considering that a composite Web service is a way of implementing functionality reuse, we propose to use aggregation and specialization relationships (at conceptual level) with a precise semantics as mechanisms to allow the composition characterization. These conceptual models could be included in other methods (as Web engineering methods) or models in order to capture the integration requirements needed to define collaborative applications.
