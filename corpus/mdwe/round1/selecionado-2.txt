An authoring environment for model-driven web applications
This paper presents a development environment and framework that supports a Model Driven Development approach to Web Application Development. In this framework, the models are described through graphical diagrams that are processed by the environment. The main purpose is to ease the development of a web application using Visual Studio {.Net} 2005 as an {IDE} and Semantic Hypermedia Development Method {(SHDM)} as development method, allowing the application architect to focus on the application modeling. We also discuss how the meta-modeling facilities of {VS} {.Net} 2005 were extensively used.
