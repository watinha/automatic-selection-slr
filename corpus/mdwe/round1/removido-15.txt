A model-driven development framework for enterprise Web services
The growing scale and complexity of the enterprise computing systems under distributed and heterogeneous environments present new challenges to system development, integration, and maintenance. In this paper, we present a model driven Web service development framework to combat these challenges. The framework capitalizes on the unified modeling language {(UML)} profile for enterprise distributed object computing {(EDOC),} {MDA} (model-driven architecture) and Web services. Within the framework, firstly, a general {PIM} (platform independent models) is created using the {EDOC} {CCA} structural specification and {CCA} choreography specification which defines the general functions of a system. Secondly, the general {PIM} is broken down into {sub-PIMs} according to functional decomposition, each of which can provide service independently and will be implemented in a Web service. Thirdly, all of the {PIMs} are transformed to Web service interface models for publication and invoking. Afterward, transform each {PIM} to a {BPEL} specified Web service orchestration model. Finally, supported by model transform techniques, the sub {EDOC} {PIMs} are implemented into Web services on specific platforms. Automatic model transformation is the key to this framework, therefore, the transformation from {EDOC} {CCA} models to {WSDL} specified Web service interface models and the transformation from {EDOC} {CCA} models to {BPEL} specified Web service orchestration models are deeply discussed, and the detailed transformation rules are proposed. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these rules and the merits of this framework.
