Adding flexibility in the model-driven engineering of user interfaces
Model-based user interface {(UI)} development environments are aimed at generating one or many {UIs} from a single model or a family of models. Model-driven engineering {(MDE)} of {UIs} is assumed to be superior to those environments since they make the {UI} design knowledge visible, explicit, and external, for instance as model-to-model transformations and model-to-code compilation rules. These transformations and rules are often considered inflexible, complex to express, and hard to develop by {UI} designers and developers who are not necessarily experts in {MDE.} In order to overcome these shortcomings, this work introduces the concept of transformation profile that consists of two definitions: model mappings, which connect source and target models in a flexible way, and transformation templates, which gather high-level parameters to apply to transformations. This work applies these concepts in a general-purpose method for {MDE} of information systems. Transformation profiles can be effectively and efficiently used in any circumstances in which transformation knowledge needs to be modified by non-experts, and flexibility, modifiability, and customization are required.
