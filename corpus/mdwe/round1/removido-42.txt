Towards a semantic infrastructure supporting model-based tool integration
With the rise of model-driven software development, more and more development tasks are being performed on models. Seamless exchange of models among different modeling tools increasingly becomes a crucial prerequisite for effective software development processes. Due to lack of interoperability, however, it is often difficult to use tools in combination, thus the potential of model-driven software development cannot be fully utilized. To tackle this problem, we propose {ModelCVS,} a system aiming at model-based tool integration. {ModelCVS} enables transparent transformation of models between different tools' languages and exchange formats, as well as versioning exploiting the rich syntax and semantics of models, thus going beyond existing low-level model transformation approaches. For this, {ModelCVS} utilizes semantic technologies in terms of ontologies and supports different integration patterns at the metamodel level. To foster reuse, a knowledge base captures essential information relevant for tool integration.
