A Methodology for {Model-Driven} Web Application Composition
Web application composition can greatly benefit from the utilization of existing frameworks and reusable components, in order to reduce development effort. Frameworks implementing the {Model-View-Controller} architectural pattern standardize the development process to a great extent, while business layer components may consist of consumers of existing web services. On this line of thought a web application can be seen as a composition of web services around a user interface flow. In this paper, an approach for the application of model-driven techniques for the automation of the development of such a web application is presented. Specifically, we present a methodology for the modeling of the application using {UML} state transition and class diagrams and the generation of the appropriate source code and configuration files. The appropriate {UML} profiles to assist the service design are defined and the final transformation is performed exploiting model parsing tools.
