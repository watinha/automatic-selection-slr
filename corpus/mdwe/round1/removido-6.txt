Experiments in model driven web courseware development for individualized learning
Disorientation and cognitive overload are two of the most serious problems in introducing interactive web based learning. Unless course content is developed by leveraging instructional design principles combined with opportunities offered by Information Technology, these problems will only proliferate as commercial and other considerations are forcing the best of teaching institutions to support web-based learning. Not all teachers can be expected to formally apply instructional design principles when putting their courses onto the web. A clean and simple model that can be used to templatize and thus simplify the task of educational content development is essential. In this paper the authors first briefly describe one such model followed by details of two real-life experimental efforts undertaken to develop courseware following this model. The model is based on small meaningful units of instruction - a concept, the interrelationship amongst concepts, type of knowledge intended to be imparted, expected performance level, instructional events and learning experience. Of the two courses, one has already been deployed and detailed feedback is being collected. The second course is also rolled out and the results from this will be available by July 2002.
