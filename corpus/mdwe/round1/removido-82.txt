Representing, analysing and managing web service protocols
In the area of Web services and service-oriented architectures, business protocols are rapidly gaining importance and mindshare as a necessary part of Web service descriptions. Their immediate benefit is that they provide developers with information on how to write clients that can correctly interact with a given service or with a set of services. In addition, once protocols become an accepted practice and service descriptions become endowed with protocol information, the middleware can be significantly extended to better support service development, binding, and execution in a number of ways, considerably simplifying the whole service life-cycle. This paper discusses the different ways in which the middleware can leverage protocol descriptions, and focuses in particular on the notions of protocol compatibility, equivalence, and replaceability. They characterize whether two services can interact based on their protocol definition, whether a service can replace another in general or when interacting with specific clients, and which are the set of possible interactions among two services.
