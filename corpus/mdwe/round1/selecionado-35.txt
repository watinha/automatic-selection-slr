Model-driven design and development of semantic Web service applications
This article proposes a model-driven methodology to design and develop semantic Web service applications and their components, described according to the emerging {WSMO} standard. In particular, we show that business processes and Web engineering models have sufficient expressive power to support the semiautomatic extraction of semantic descriptions (i.e., {WSMO} ontologies, goals, Web services, and mediators), thus partially hiding the complexity of dealing with semantics. Our method is based on existing models for the specification of business processes {(BPMN)} combined with Web engineering models for designing and developing semantically rich Web applications {(WebML).} The proposed approach leads from an abstract view of the business needs to a concrete implementation of the application by means of several design steps; high-level models are transformed into software components. Our framework increases the efficiency of the whole design process, yielding to the construction of semantic Web service applications spanning over several enterprises.
