Progress in Web-based decision support technologies
World Wide Web technologies have transformed the design, development, implementation and deployment of decision support systems. This article reviews and summarizes recent technology developments, current usage of Web-based {DSS,} and trends in the deployment of such systems. Many firms use the Web as a medium to convey information about {DSS} products or to distribute {DSS} software. The use of Web-based computation to provide product demonstrations or to deploy {DSS} applications for remote access remains less common. The academic literature on Web-based {DSS} is largely focused on applications and implementations, and only a few articles examine architectural issues or provide design guidelines based on empirical evidence.
