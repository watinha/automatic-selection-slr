{Model-Driven} Web Services Development
Web service technologies are becoming increasinglyimportant for integrating systems and services. There ismuch activity and interest around standardization andusage of web service technologies. The Unified {ModelingLanguage} {(UML)} and the Model Driven {Architecture(MDA)Â¿} provide a framework that can be applied toweb service development. This paper describes a modeldrivenweb service development process, where webservice descriptions are imported into {UML} models;integrated into composite web services; and the new webservice descriptions are exported. The main contributionsof this paper are conversion rules between {UML} and webservices described by Web Service Description {Language(WSDL)} documents and {XML} Schema.
