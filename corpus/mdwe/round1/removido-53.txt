Engineering a design method for web content management implementations
The process of implementing a Web Content Management System {(WCM)} can be complex and time consuming. We argue that there is a need for a web engineering methods specifically addressing {WCM} implementations. In this paper we present the design phase of our Web Engineering Method {(WEM).} The design phase of {WEM} addresses fourteen identified key {WCM} concepts and consists of the main activities: Conceptual Design, Architecture Design, Presentation Design and Detailed Component Design. The proposed method is validated through an expert validation and a case study. Based on the outcome, we developed a prototype of a {CASE-application} supporting the Conceptual Design activity. Future research includes further development of the {CASE-application} including the abstract syntax and automation of the transition.
