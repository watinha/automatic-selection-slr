Workshop proceedings of the sixth international conference on Web engineering
The Sixth International Conference on Web Engineering {(ICWE} 2006) held in Palo Alto, California, at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, hosted the workshops {MDWE,} {AEWSE} and {SMIWEP-MATeS.} This volume of the {ACM} Digital Library contains a selection of papers presented at the three workshops which took place on July, 10th and July, {11th.ICWE} 2006 and the associated workshops aim to promote research and scientific exchange related to Web Engineering and to bring together practitioners, scientists and researchers, as well as those interested in learning more about Web Engineering. The Web Engineering discipline comprises the development and use of models, methodologies, technologies, tools and techniques that are used to develop and maintain Web applications within economic constraints. In the era of Web-based information and services we are living in, the development of such Web systems is demanding our attention in order to provide sound and engineered solutions to specific problems in the Web Engineering field. The articles presented at the {ICWE} 2006 workshops have proposed novel results in this area focusing each on a specific {domain:The} Second International Workshop on {Model-Driven} Web Engineering {(MDWE'06)} focused on model-based and model-driven development of Web applications. The main goal of this workshop series is to promote the use of models and model transformations as well as the definition of domain specific modeling languages {(DSML)} and construction of {CASE} tools supporting model-driven processes. Strengths and weaknesses of model-driven approaches in the Web domain were lively discussed during the {workshop.The} First International Workshop on Adaptation and Evolution in Web Systems Engineering {(AEWSE'06)} aimed at bringing together researchers and practitioners with different research interests, belonging to communities like Web Engineering, Adaptive Hypermedia, User Modeling, Active Databases, Semantic Web, Ontology Evolution, Database Evolution, Temporal Data, Software Engineering and Mobile Computing. The goal of the workshop was to address adaptation and evolution of Web applications both during design, implementation and {deployment.The} Joint Workshop on Web Services Modeling and Implementation using Sound Web Engineering Practices and Methods, Architectures \& Technologies for {e-Service} Engineering {(SMIWEP-MATeS'06)} covered current state-of-the-art and best practices in {e-Service} engineering, focusing on aspects such as development of semantic Web applications, integration of technologies, requirements engineering, patterns and reference architectures, design methodologies and processes and quality models.
