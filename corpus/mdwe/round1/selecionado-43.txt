Model transformations from requirements to web system design
Requirements models are used to specify system functionalitiesfrom the customer viewpoint and are the starting point of softwaredevelopment. However, most Web engineering approaches do notprovide a systematic method to build design models fromrequirements specification. We propose an approach using modeltransformations to close this gap. Our transformation rules aredefined in the {QVT
