Service Mosaic: A {Model-Driven} Framework for Web Services {Life-Cycle} Management
Although Web services provide abstractions for simplifying integration at lower levels of the interaction stacks, they don't yet help simplify integration at higher abstraction levels such as business-level interaction protocols. Using a model-driven framework for Web services life-cycle management, the authors help facilitate the scalable development and maintenance of service-oriented applications by analyzing and managing Web service business protocols. Instead of using simple black and white measures,they identify different classes of protocol compatibility and replaceability. They implemented this framework in a prototype platform called Service Mosaic.
