Towards using visual process models to control enterprise systems functionalities
In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for web-service development with the intention of {IT} infrastructure integration in enterprise models. This implies the extension of existing conceptual modelling languages with language constructs that aim at model information transparency on a web-service basis. Therefore, we assess the grammatical specification of conceptual modelling languages for business domains. Acting on the language meta-level means in this context the introduction of web-service-related constructs into widely used visual modelling grammars. The vision is the situation-dependent adaptation of software functionality to the actual documented utilisation. Economical relevance results from the reduction of significant discrepancies between enterprise systems functionalities and business requirements.
