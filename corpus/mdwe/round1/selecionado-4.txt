{Model-Driven} Web Engineering for the Automated Configuration of Web Content Management Systems
With the growing use of Web Content Management Systems for the support of complex online business processes, traditional implementation solutions proofed to be inefficient. Specifically the gap between business requirements and the realized Web application should be closed. This paper presents the development of a modeling tool for the automated configuration of Web Content Management Systems {(WCM)} which aims to reduce the complexity and increase the transparency of implementations. It allows business users to configure the business processes without technical support. We combine fragments of existing Web Engineering methods and specify an abstract and concrete syntax based on a domain model and end user analysis. The resulting {WebForm} Diagram has been implemented in a prototype and validated by subject matter experts. This research is part of a project to develop the Web Engineering Method {(WEM)} which provides an overall method towards a full coverage of the specification, design, realization, implementation and maintenance of {WCM-based} Web applications.
