{ActiveRDF:} Embedding Semantic Web data into object-oriented languages
Semantic Web applications share a large portion of development effort with database-driven Web applications. Existing approaches for development of these database-driven applications cannot be directly applied to Semantic Web data due to differences in the underlying data model. We develop a mapping approach that embeds Semantic Web data into object-oriented languages and thereby enables reuse of existing Web application frameworks. We analyse the relation between the Semantic Web and the Web, and survey the typical data access patterns in Semantic Web applications. We discuss the mismatch between object-oriented programming languages and Semantic Web data, for example in the semantics of class membership, inheritance relations, and object conformance to schemas. We present {ActiveRDF,} an object-oriented {API} for managing {RDF} data that offers full manipulation and querying of {RDF} data, does not rely on a schema and fully conforms to {RDF(S)} semantics. {ActiveRDF} can be used with different {RDF} data stores: adapters have been implemented to generic {SPARQL} endpoints, Sesame, Jena, Redland and {YARS} and new adapters can be added easily. We demonstrate the usage of {ActiveRDF} and its integration with the popular Ruby on Rails framework which enables rapid development of Semantic Web applications.
