Model-driven development of composite web applications
As the number of available web services increases, the development of web applications that integrate existing web services becomes more and more popular. This class of web applications can be seen as the composition of web services around a user interface flow. In this paper, the application of model-driven techniques for the development of such user-centric web applications is presented. An approach for the modeling of the application using {UML} class and state transition diagrams and the transformation to appropriate platform specific code is presented. The service design is based on the introduced {UML} profiles, whereas on code level frameworks implementing the {Model-View-Controller} architectural pattern are targeted.
