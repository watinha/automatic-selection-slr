{MDA-based} tool chain for web services development
One of the challenges in Model Driven Architecture {(MDA)} is the variety of tools which are not interoperable with each other. Also, a design flow supporting different phases of {MDA-based} development is often missing. This paper presents a tool chain and design flow for {MDA-based} Web Services development. The presented tool chain covers modelling with domain-specific Unified Modelling Language {(UML)} profiles, transformation of the {UML} models into Web Services Definition Language {(WSDL)} files, and Java code generation. The tool chain is validated in a case study where it is used in the development of a web service called Resource Availability Service {(RAS).} In the validation, the tool chain worked well, since the proportion of generated code in {RAS} is over 95\%. The residual 5\% of the code includes manual integration and business logic. User experiences indicate that using the tool chain improves the developer productivity in Web Services development.
