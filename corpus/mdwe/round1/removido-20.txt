A Model Driven Development Framework for Enterprise Web Services
The growing scale and complexity of the enterprise computing systems under distributed and heterogeneous environments present new challenges to system development, integration, and maintenance. In this paper, we present a model driven web service development framework to combat these challenges. The framework capitalizes on the {UML} profile for Enterprise Distributed Object Computing {(EDOC),} {MDA} and Web Services. Within the framework, first, the platform independent models {(PIMs)} are created using the {EDOC} profile. Second, the {PIMs} are broken down into sub {PIMs} according to functional decomposition, each of which can provide service independently and will be implemented in a web service. Then, these sub {PIMs} are transformed into the corresponding web service interface models for service publication and invoking. Finally, supported by model transform techniques, the sub {PIMs} are implemented into web services on specific platforms. Automatic model transformation is the key to this framework, therefore, the transformation from {EDOC} models to Web Service interface models within this framework is deeply discussed, and the detailed transformation rules are proposed. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these rules and the merits of this framework.
