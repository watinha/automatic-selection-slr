A Framework of {Model-Driven} Web Application Testing
Web applications have become complex and crucial in many fields. In order to assure their quality, a high demand for systematic methodologies of Web application testing is emerging. In this paper, a methodology of {Model-Driven} Testing {(MDT)} for Web application is presented. Model is the core of this method. Web application model is built to describe the system under testing. Test case models are generated based-on the web application model. Test deployment model and test control model are designed to describe the environment and process of test execution. The test engine executes test cases based-on the test deployment and control model automatically. After that, testing results are reflected to test case models. A framework is designed for supporting this methodology. In order to get better extensibility and flexibility, it is loose-coupled by a modeler and a tester. The modeler enables developers to design meta-models, and is responsible for creating, visualizing and saving models. The tester takes in charge of recovering the tested Web application model, generating test cases, and executing test.
