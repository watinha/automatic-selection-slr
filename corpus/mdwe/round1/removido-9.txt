Comparison of Two Distinctive Model Driven Web Service Orchestration Proposals
The concept of {MDA} (model driven architecture) aims at the goal of longevity (through business logic and architecture migration between different platforms) and quality improvement (through raising the level of abstraction). In the context of business process modeling and execution a frictionless mapping between high level, platform independent business process definition and platform specific, executable code has to be achieved. In this paper we compare two existing real world mapping scenarios of {IBM} and Microsoft concerning Web Service Orchestration. One "topdown" approach starting with high-level {UML} models down to executable code, the other as a "bottom-up" approach, with proprietary modeling integrated within the {IDE.} We try to answer the question how far both proposals implemented the {MDA} concept yet and discuss how they could support our current project of a service oriented architecture for the manufacturing shop floor domain.
