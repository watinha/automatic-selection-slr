A Systematic Review of Cross- vs. Within-Company Cost Estimation
Studies
The objective of this paper is to determine under what circumstances
individual organisations would be able to rely on cross-company based
estimation models. We performed a systematic review of studies that
compared predictions from crosscompany models with predictions from
within-company models based on analysis of project data. Ten papers
compared cross-company and within-company estimation models, however,
only seven of the papers presented independent results. Of those
seven, three found that crosscompany models were as good as within-company
models, four found cross-company models were significantly worse
than within-company models. Experimental procedures used by the studies
d iffered making it impossible to undertake formal meta-analysis
of the results. The main trend distinguishing study results was that
studies with small single company data sets (i.e. <20 projects) that
used leaveone-out cross-validation all found that the within-company
model was significantly more accurate than

the cross-company model. The results of this review are inconclusive.
It is clear that some organisations would be ill-served by cross-company
models whereas others would benefit. Further studies are needed,
but they must be independent (i.e. based on different data bases
or at least different single comp any data sets). In addition, experimenters
need to standardise their experimental procedures to enable formal
meta-analysis.
