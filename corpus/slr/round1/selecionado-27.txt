What do we know about defect detection methods?
A survey of defect detection studies comparing inspection and testing  	techniques yields practical recommendations: use inspections for  	requirements and design defects, and use testing for code. Evidence-based  	software engineering can help software practitioners decide which  	methods to use and for what purpose. EBSE involves defining relevant  	questions, surveying and appraising avail able empirical evidence,  	and integrating and evaluating new practices in the target environment.  	This article helps define questions regarding defect detection techniques  	and presents a survey of empirical studies on testing and inspection  	techniques. We then interpret the findings in terms of practical  	use. The term defect always relates to one or more underlying faults  	in an artifact such as code. In the context of this article, defects  	map to single faults.
