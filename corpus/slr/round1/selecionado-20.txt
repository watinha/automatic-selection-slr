A survey on software estimation in the Norwegian industry
We provide an overview of the estimation methods that software companies  	apply to estimate their projects, why those methods are chosen, and  	how accurate they are. In order to improve estimation accuracy, such  	knowledge is essential. We conducted an in-depth survey, where information  	was collected through structured interviews with senior managers  	from 18 different companies and project managers of 52 different  	projects. We analyzed information about estimation approach, effort  	estimation accuracy and bias, schedule estimation accuracy and bias,  	delivered functionality and other estimation related information.  	Our results suggest, for example, that average effort overruns are  	41%, that the estimation performance has not changed much the last  	10-20 years, that expert estimation is the dominating estimation  	method, that estimation accuracy is not much impacted by use of formal  	estimation models, and that software managers tend to believe that  	the estimation accuracy of their company is better than it actually  	is.
