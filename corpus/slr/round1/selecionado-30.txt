Software effort estimation terminology: the tower of Babel
It is well documented that the software industry suffers from frequent
cost overruns. A contributing factor is, we believe, the imprecise
estimation terminology in use. A lack of clarity and precision in
the use of estimation terms reduces the interpretability of estimation
accuracy results, makes the communication of estimates difficult,
and lowers the learning possibilities. This paper reports on a structured
review of typical software effort estimation terminology in software
engineering textbooks and software estimation research papers. The
review provides evidence that the term ‘effort estimate’ is frequently
used without sufficient clarification of its meaning, and that estimation
accuracy is often evaluated without ensuring that the estimated and
the actual effort are comparable. Guidelines are suggested on how
to reduce this lack of clarity and precision in terminology.
