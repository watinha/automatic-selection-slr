Systematic review of Web engineering research
This paper uses a systematic literature review as means of investigating
the rigor of claims arising from Web engineering research. Rigor
is measured using criteria combined from software engineering research.
We reviewed 173 papers and results have shown that only 5% would
be considered rigorous methodologically. In addition to presenting
our results, we also provide suggestions for improvement of Web engineering
research based on lessons learnt by the software engineering community.
