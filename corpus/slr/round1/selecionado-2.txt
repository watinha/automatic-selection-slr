Cross versus Within-Company Cost Estimation Studies: A Systematic
Review
The objective of this paper is to determine under what circumstances
individual organizations would be able to rely on cross-company-based
estimation models. We performed a systematic review of studies that
compared predictions from cross-company models with predictions from
within-company models based on analysis of project data. Ten papers
compared cross-company and within-company estimation models; however,
only seven presented independent results. Of those seven, three found
that cross-company models were not significantly different from within-company
models, and four found that cross-company models were significantly
worse than within-company models. Experimental procedures used by
the studies differed making it impossible to undertake formal meta-analysis
of the results. The main trend distinguishing study results was that
studies with small within-company data sets (i.e., $20 projects)
that used leave-one-out cross validation all found that the within-company
model was significantly different (better) from the cross-company
model. The results of this review are inconclusive. It is clear that
some organizations would be ill-served by cross-company models whereas
others would benefit. Further studies are needed, but they must be
independent (i.e., based on different data bases or at least different
single company data sets) and should address specific hypotheses
concerning the conditions that would favor cross-company or within-company
models. In addition, experimenters need to standardize their experimental
procedures to enable formal meta-analysis, and recommendations are
made in Section 3.
