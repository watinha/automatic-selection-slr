Research in computer science: an empirical study
In this paper, we examine the state of computer science (CS) research  	from the point of view of the following research questions: What  	topics do CS researchers address? What research approaches do CS  	researchers use? What research methods do CS researchers use? On  	what reference disciplines does CS research depend? At what levels  	of analysis do CS researchers conduct research? To answer these questions,  	we examined 628 papers published between 1995 and 1999 in 13 leading  	research journals in the CS field. Our results suggest that while  	CS research examines a variety of technical topics it is relatively  	focused in terms of the level at which research is conducted as well  	as the research techniques used. Further, CS research seldom relies  	on work outside the discipline for its theoretical foundations. We  	present our findings as an evaluation of the state of current research  	and as groundwork for future CS research efforts.
