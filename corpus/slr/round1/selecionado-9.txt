A survey of controlled experiments in software engineering
The classical method for identifying cause-effect relationships is
to conduct controlled experiments. This paper reports upon the present
state of how controlled experiments in software engineering are conducted
and the extent to which relevant information is reported. Among the
5,453 scientific articles published in 12 leading software engineering
journals and conferences in the decade from 1993 to 2002, 103 articles
(1.9 percent) reported controlled experiments in which individuals
or teams performed one or more software engineering tasks. This survey
quantitatively characterizes the topics of the experiments and their
subjects (number of subjects, students versus professionals, recruitment,
and rewards for participation), tasks (type of task, duration, and
type and size of application) and environments (location, development
tools). Furthermore, the survey reports on how internal and external
validity is addressed and the extent to which experiments are replicated.
The gathered data reflects the relevance of software engineering
experiments to industrial practice and the scientific maturity of
software engineering research.
