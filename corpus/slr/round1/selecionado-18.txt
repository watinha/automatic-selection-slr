Estimation of software development work effort: evidence on expert
judgement and formal models
The review presented in this paper examines the evidence on the use
of expert judgement, formal models, and a combination of these two
approaches when estimating (forecasting) software development work
effort. Sixteen relevant studies were identified and reviewed. The
review found that the average accuracy of expert judgement-based
effort estimates was higher than the average accuracy of the models
in ten of the sixteen studies. Two indicators of higher accuracy
of judgement-based effort estimates were estimation models not calibrated
to the organization using the model, and important contextual information
possessed by the experts not included in the formal estimation models.
Four of the reviewed studies evaluated effort estimates based on
a combination of expert judgement and models. The mean estimation
accuracy of the combination-based methods was similar to the best
of that of the other estimation methods.
