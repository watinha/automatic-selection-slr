Achieving Quality in Open Source Software
The open source software community has published a substantial body
of research on OSS quality. Focusing on this peer-reviewed body of
work lets us draw conclusions from empirical data rather than rely
on the large volume of evangelical opinion that has historically
dominated this field. This body of published research has become
much more critical and objective in its efforts to understand OSS
development, and a consensus has emerged on the key components of
high-quality OSS delivery. This article reviews this body of research
and draws out lessons learned, investigating how the approaches used
to deliver high-quality OSS differ from, and can be incorporated
into, closed-source software development.
