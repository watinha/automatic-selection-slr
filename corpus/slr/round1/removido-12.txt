Distribution Dimensions in Software Development Projects:Â A Taxonomy
Distribution in software development projects is a complex phenomenon
with many dimensions. In addition to the obvious physical dimension
entailed by geographically dispersed project personnel and resources,
projects must contend with organizational distribution among various
company departments, for example, as well as temporal and stakeholder
distributions. A review of the literature on globally distributed
software development projects produced a preliminary taxonomy based
on a dimensional analysis of distribution. Developers can use this
taxonomy to identify and visualize their project's distribution dimensions
and scopes. A real-world case study of the taxonomy's use illuminates
its value, as well as common challenges and possible solutions to
distribution problems.This article is part of a special issue on
Global Software Development.
