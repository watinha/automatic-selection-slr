A systematic review of software development cost estimation studies
This paper aims to provide a basis for the improvement of software
estimation research through a systematic review of previous work.
The review identifies 304 software cost estimation papers in 76 journals
and classifies the papers according to research topic, estimation
approach, research approach, study context and data set. A Web-based
library of these cost estimation papers is provided to ease the identification
of relevant estimation research results. The review results combined
with other knowledge provide support for recommendations for future
software cost estimation research, including 1) increase the breadth
of the search for relevant studies, 2) search manually for relevant
papers within a carefully selected set of journals when completeness
is essential, 3) conduct more studies on estimation methods commonly
used by the software industry, and 4) increase the awareness of how
properties of the data sets impact the results when evaluating estimation
methods.
