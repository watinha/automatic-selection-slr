Hands-on, simulated and remote laboratories: a comparative literature
review
Laboratory-based courses play a critical role in scientific education.
Automation is changing the nature of these laboratories, and there
is a long-running debate about the value of hands-on versus simulated
laboratories. In addition, the introduction of remote laboratories
adds a third category to the debate. Through a review of the literature
related to these labs in education, the authors draw several conclusions
about the state of current research. The debate over different technologies
is confounded by the use of different educational objectives as criteria
for judging the laboratories: Hands-on advocates emphasize design
skills, while remote lab advocates focus on conceptual understanding.
We observe that the boundaries among the three labs are blurred in
the sense that most laboratories are mediated by computers, and that
the psychology of presence may be as important as technology. We
also discuss areas for future research.
