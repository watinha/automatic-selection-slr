Impact of software engineering research on the practice of software
configuration management
SCM (Software Configuration Management) is arguably one of the most
successful software engineering disciplines. It is difficult to imagine
this kind of success would have prevailed without research fueling
continuous innovations. This paper demonstrates that the impact of
this research, whether industrial or academic in nature, is undeniable
- most fundamental techniques underlying current SCM systems were
first published in one form or another. Like any other field, SCM
research has had its successes and failures. Certain ideas are universally
adopted, others have had limited impact, and yet others never saw
fruition. Timing has been critical: whereas some contributions could
immediately be related to practical, day-to-day problems, others
were too early for their time and not practically relevant for the
problems then at hand.
