In search of what we experimentally know about unit testing
Gathering evidence in any discipline is a lengthy procedure, requiring  	experimentation and empirical confirmation to transform information  	from mere opinion to undisputed fact. Software engineering is a relatively  	young field and experimental SE is even younger, so undisputed facts  	are few and far between. Nevertheless, ESE's relevance is growing  	because experimental results can help practitioners make better decisions.  	We have aggregated results from unit-testing experiments with the  	aim of identifying information with some experimental basis that  	might help practitioners make decisions. Most of the experiments  	focus on two important characteristics of testing techniques: effectiveness  	and efficiency. Some other experiments study the quality of test-case  	sets according to different criteria.
