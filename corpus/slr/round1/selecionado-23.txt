Overlooked aspects of COTS-based development
Although developing with commercial-off-the-shelf components is gaining
more attention from both research and industrial communities, most
literature on the topic doesn't clearly identify context variables
such as the type of products, projects, and systems. In particular,
the literature often lacks a definition of "COTS product," or, when
a definition is present, it invariably disagrees with other studies.
A shared definition would improve discourse and enable researchers
to meta-analyze published empirical data. After a speculative effort
to define and classify COTS products, we decided to obtain this much-needed
understanding from the bottom up. We asked people involved in industrial
projects to name the key features in COTS-based development and to
tell us what they think constitutes a COTS product. We present the
interview results in the form of six theses, which contradict widely
accepted (or simply undisputed) ideas. We also present a definition
of "COTS product" that captures the key features.
