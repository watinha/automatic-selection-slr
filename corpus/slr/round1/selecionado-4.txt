The consistency of empirical comparisons of regression and analogy-based
software project cost prediction
The objective is to determine the consistency within and between results
in empirical studies of software engineering cost estimation. We
focus on regression and analogy techniques as these are commonly
used. We conducted an exhaustive literature search using predefined
inclusion and exclusion criteria and identified 67 journal papers
and 104 conference papers. From this sample we identified 11 journal
papers and 9 conference papers that used both methods. Our analysis
found that about 25% of studies were internally inconclusive. We
also found that there is approximately equal evidence in favour of,
and against analogy-based methods. We confirm the lack of consistency
in the findings and argue that this inconsistent pattern from 20
different studies comparing regression and analogy is somewhat disturbing.
It suggests that we need to ask more detailed questions than just:
What is the best prediction system?
