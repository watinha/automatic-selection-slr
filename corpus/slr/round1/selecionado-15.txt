A systematic review of theory use in software engineering experiments
Empirically based theories are generally perceived as foundational  	to science. However, in many disciplines, the nature, role and even  	the necessity of theories remain matters for debate, particularly  	in young or practical disciplines such as software engineering. This  	article reports a systematic review of the explicit use of theory  	in a comprehensive set of 103 articles reporting experiments, from  	of a total of 5,453 articles published in major software engineering  	journals and conferences in the decade 1993-2002. Of the 103 articles,  	24 use a total of 40 theories in various ways to explain the cause-effect  	relationship(s) under investigation. The majority of these use theory  	in the experimental design to justify research questions and hypotheses,  	some use theory to provide post hoc explanations of their results,  	and a few test or modify theory. A third of the theories are proposed  	by authors of the reviewed articles. The interdisciplinary nature  	of the theories used is greater than that of research in software  	engineering in general. We found that theory use and awareness of  	theoretical issues are present, but that theory-driven research is,  	as yet, not a major issue in empirical software engineering. Several  	articles comment explicitly on the lack of relevant theory. We call  	for an increased awareness of the potential benefits of involving  	theory, when feasible. To support software engineering researchers  	who wish to use theory, we show which of the reviewed articles on  	which topics use which theories for what purposes, as well as details  	of the theories' characteristics.
