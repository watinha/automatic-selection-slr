Model-Based Performance Prediction in Software Development:Â A Survey
Over the last decade, a lot of research has been directed toward integrating  	performance analysis into the software development process. Traditional  	software development methods focus on software correctness, introducing  	performance issues later in the development process. This approach  	does not take into account the fact that performance problems may  	require considerable changes in design, for example, at the software  	architecture level, or even worse at the requirement analysis level.  	Several approaches were proposed in order to address early software  	performance analysis. Although some of them have been successfully  	applied, we are still far from seeing performance analysis integrated  	into ordinary software development. In this paper, we present a comprehensive  	review of recent research in the field of model-based performance  	prediction at software development time in order to assess the maturity  	of the field and point out promising research directions.
