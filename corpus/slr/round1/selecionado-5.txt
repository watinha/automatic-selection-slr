On the success of empirical studies in the international conference
on software engineering
Due to the importance of software architectural documents, its review
became a fundamental activity for the success of software projects
and for the software quality improvement. Software architecture evaluation
is a subject that has been intensively studied by diverse research
groups. However there is a lack of formal reviews aiming at identifying
the existence of software evaluation approaches. The bibliographical
reviews that have been accomplished can not be audited or repeated,
making them entirely dependent upon the researchers for the obtained
results, which could introduce bias on the research results. To prevent
these limitations, this paper describes a systematic review aiming
at the dentification of existing architectural evaluation approaches.
Based on the result of this review, we summarize the main characteristics,
advantages and limitations of the identified evaluation approaches
and propose the requirements for a checklist based software architectural
documents evaluation approach.
