A review of studies on expert estimation of software development
effort
This paper provides an extensive review of studies related to expert
estimation of software development effort. The main goal and contribution
of the review is to support the research on expert estimation, e.g.,
to ease other researcher's search for relevant expert estimation
studies. In addition, we provide software practitioners with useful
estimation guidelines, based on the research-based knowledge of expert
estimation processes. The review results suggest that expert estimation
is the most frequently applied estimation strategy for software projects,
that there is no substantial evidence in favour of use of estimation
models, and that there are situations where we can expect expert
estimates to be more accurate than formal estimation models. The
following 12 expert estimation "best practice" guidelines are evaluated
through the review: (1) evaluate estimation accuracy, but avoid high
evaluation pressure; (2) avoid conflicting estimation goals; (3)
ask the estimators to justify and criticize their estimates; (4)
avoid irrelevant and unreliable estimation information; (5) use documented
data from previous development tasks; (6) find estimation experts
with relevant domain background and good estimation records; (7)
Estimate top-down and bottom-up, independently of each other; (8)
use estimation checklists; (9) combine estimates from different experts
and estimation strategies; (10) assess the uncertainty of the estimate;
(11) provide feedback on estimation accuracy and development task
relations; and, (12) provide estimation training opportunities. We
found supporting evidence for all 12 estimation principles, and provide
suggestions on how to implement them in software organizations.
