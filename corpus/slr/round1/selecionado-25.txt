Reviewing 25 years of testing technique experiments
Mature knowledge allows engineering disciplines the achievement of  	predictable results. Unfortunately, the type of knowledge used in  	software engineering can be considered to be of a relatively low  	maturity, and developers are guided by intuition, fashion or market-speak  	rather than by facts or undisputed statements proper to an engineering  	discipline. Testing techniques determine different criteria for selecting  	the test cases that will be used as input to the system under examination,  	which means that an effective and efficient selection of test cases  	conditions the success of the tests. The knowledge for selecting  	testing techniques should come from studies that empirically justify  	the benefits and application conditions of the different techniques.  	This paper analyzes the maturity level of the knowledge about testing  	techniques by examining existing empirical studies about these techniques.  	We have analyzed their results, and obtained a testing technique  	knowledge classification based on their factuality and objectivity,  	according to four parameters.
