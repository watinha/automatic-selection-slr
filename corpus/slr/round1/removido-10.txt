Stakeholders in Global Requirements Engineering: Lessons Learned  	from Practice
Due to its communication and collaboration-intensive nature, as well  	as inherent interaction with most other development processes, the  	practice of requirements engineering is becoming a key challenge  	in global software engineering (GSE). In distributed projects, cross-functional  	stakeholder groups must specify and manage requirements across cultural,  	time-zone, and organizational boundaries. This creates a unique set  	of problems, not only when an organization opens new development  	subsidiaries across the world but also when software development  	is a multiorganizational business affair. We need innovative processes  	and technologies to manage stakeholders' expectations and interaction  	in global projects. This article reports on the state of the practice,  	drawn from industrial empirical studies, of stakeholders' interaction  	in global RE. The article revisits stakeholders' needs in global  	RE, discusses the challenges they face in distributed interaction,  	and offers practical advice to alleviate these challenges, as distilled  	from empirical studies of GSE practice.
