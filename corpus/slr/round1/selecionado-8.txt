Do SQA programs work – CMM works: A meta analysis
Many software development professionals and managers of software development  	organizations re not fully convinced in the profitability of investments  	for the advancement of SQA systems. The results included in each  	of the articles we found, cannot lead to general conclusions on the  	impact of investments in upgrading an SQA system. Our meta analysis  	was based on CMM level transition (CMMLT) analysis of available publications  	and was for the seven most common performance metric. The CMMLT analysis  	is applicable for combined analysis of empirical data from many sources.  	Each record in our meta analysis database is calculated as “after-before  	ratio”, which is nearly free of the studied organization’s characteristics.Because  	the CMM guidelines and SQA requirement are similar, we claim that  	the results for CMM programs are also applicable to investments in  	SQA systems The extensive database of over 1,800 projects from a  	variety of 19 information sources leading to the meta analysis results  	– proved that investments in CMM programs and similarly in SQA systems  	contribute to software development performance.
