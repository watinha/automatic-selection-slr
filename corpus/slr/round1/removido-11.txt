Architecting for usability: a survey
Over the years the software engineering community has increasingly  	realized the important role software architecture plays in fulfilling  	the quality requirements of a system. The quality attributes of a  	software system are, to a large extent determined by the system’s  	software architecture. In recent years, the software engineering  	community has developed various tools and techniques that allow for  	design for quality attributes, such as performance or maintainability,  	at the software architecture level. We believe this design approach  	can be applied not only to “traditional” quality attributes such  	as performance or maintainability but also to usability. This survey  	explores the feasibility of such a design approach. Current practice  	is surveyed from the perspective of a software architect. Are there  	any design methods that allow for design for usability at the architectural  	level? Are there any evaluation tools that allow assessment of architectures  	for their support of usability? What is usability? A framework is  	presented which visualizes these three research questions. Usability  	should drive design at all stages, but current usability engineering  	practice fails to fully achieve this goal. Our survey shows that  	there are no design techniques or assessment tools that allow for  	design for usability at the architectural level.
