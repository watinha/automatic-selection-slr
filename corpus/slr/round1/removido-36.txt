A literature survey of the quality economics of defect-detection  	techniques
Over the last decades, a considerable amount of empirical knowledge  	about the efficiency of defect-detection techniques has been accumulated.  	Also a few surveys have summarised those studies with different focuses,  	usually for a specific type of technique. This work reviews the results  	of empirical studies and associates them with a model of software  	quality economics. This allows a better comparison of the different  	techniques and supports the application of the model in practice  	as several parameters can be approximated with typical average values.  	The main contributions are the provision of average values of several  	interesting quantities w.r.t. defect detection and the identification  	of areas that need further research because of the limited knowledge  	available.
