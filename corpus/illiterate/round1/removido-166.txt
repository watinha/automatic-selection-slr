It is an essential issue to show how small- and medium-sized enterprises 	(SMEs) and micro enterprises in developing countries can profit from 	the opportunities presented through the use of information and communication 	technologies ICTs. This fosters development and helps narrowing the 	digital divide. The paper presents a business model framework that 	helps analysing ICT-based business models and illustrates it through 	the Village Phone Program of the telecommunication operator Grameen 	Phone in Bangladesh. Furthermore, the paper proposes a so-called 	business model handbook to improve knowledge transfer related to 	ICT-based business models.
