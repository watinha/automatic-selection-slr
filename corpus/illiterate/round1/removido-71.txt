Development of a localized e-commerce for music using indigenous
knowledge - a South African experience
This paper presents a project currently underway in the Eastern Cape
province of South Africa. The project is aimed at providing solutions
for underprivileged and disadvantaged communities, to help solve
some of their needs by creating localized computer-based solutions
based on indigenous knowledge. This would help bridge the digital
divide, as these computer solutions are closer to the local users.
The project entails studying the community in question and understanding
their way of life and then develop software solutions that use features
that they are familiar with and use their language. The project asks
the community to partake in the development of the solution and then
reap benefits from whatever revenue stream the project would enable.
An added benefit is that we should be able to preserve the cultural
aspects of the community while bringing forth best class modernity.
Key areas that the project affects are: education, music, artworks,
written or documented history etc. Younger as well as future generations
have a chance to be inventive, innovative and hopefully become the
future developers and develop their own software solutions.
