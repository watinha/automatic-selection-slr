Pyr.mea.IT: permeating IT towards the base of the pyramid
Most of the existing IT applications are designed to cater to a small
fraction of the human population. The precluded set consists of more
than a billion people who either cannot afford a PC and Internet
or are not skilled enough to be able to use them. However, the IT
needs of this segment is similar in nature and perhaps more crucial
than that of the current user segment. Designing systems for these
underprivileged people poses several technological challenges: Due
to low literacy levels the user interface has to be radically simplified,
and the user devices have to be affordable. These and other requirements
motivate a shift of complexity and computation from end-user devices
to the network, tremendously increasing the expectations from the
infrastructure. In this paper, we present an overview of technology
developed and solutions built under Pyr.mea.IT project towards enabling
IT for the masses.
