Preliminary testing of a just-in-time, user-defined values clarification 	exercise to aid lower literate women in making informed breast cancer 	treatment decisions
Objective To report on the initial testing of a values clarification 	exercise utilizing a jewellery box within a computerized patient 	decision aid (CPtDA) designed to assist women in making a surgical 	breast cancer treatment decision.   	Design Pre-post design, with patients interviewed after diagnosis, 	and then after completing the CPtDA sometime later at their preoperative 	visit.   	Sample Fifty-one female patients, who are low literate and na√Øve computer 	users, newly diagnosed with early stage breast cancer from two urban 	public hospitals.   	Intervention A computerized decision aid that combines entertainment-education 	(edutainment) with enhanced (factual) content. An interactive jewellery 	box is featured to assist women in: (1) recording and reflecting 	over issues of concern with possible treatments, (2) deliberating 	over surgery decision, and (3) communicating with physician and significant 	others.   	Outcomes Patients' use of the jewellery box to store issues during 	completion of the CPtDA, and perceived clarity of values in making 	a treatment decision, as measured by a low literacy version of the 	Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS).   	Results Over half of the participants utilized the jewellery box to 	store issues they found concerning about the treatments. On average, 	users flagged over 13 issues of concern with the treatments. Scores 	on the DCS Uncertainty and Feeling Unclear about Values subscales 	were lower after the intervention compared to before the decision 	was made.   	Conclusions A values clarification exercise using an interactive jewellery 	box may be a promising method for promoting informed treatment decision 	making by low literacy breast cancer patients.
