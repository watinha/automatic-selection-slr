Using an intergenerational communications system as a 'light-weight'
technology probe
A problem with the technology probe [1] approach is the substantial
time required to gain results. For prototype technological systems,
a further problem is the requirement that systems are deployed into
non- technical end-user's homes, where they are comparatively hard
to maintain. Even a robust system may be vulnerable to unavoidable
problems in these kinds of environment (for example, bandwidth outages
in a communications device). We introduce a light-weight procedure
that sacrifices some of the realism associated with technology probes
in favor of ease of deployment and speed of information gathering.We
apply our methods to the "Keep in Touch" (KiT) intergenerational
communications system, and describe some preliminary results that
we have obtained.
