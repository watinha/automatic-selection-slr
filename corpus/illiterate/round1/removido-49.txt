Challenging interfaces/redesigning users
As the identity of the computer user becomes more diverse, software
developers can no longer assume familiarity with legacy systems or
perfect vision, motor control and memory. The development of Piloot
(for users with learning difficulties) and SeeWord (for dyslexic
readers) shows that systems can be usable and accessible for 'non-typical'
user groups. It is no longer appropriate to design 'general purpose'
software that excludes users because of their age or minor impairments.
Piloot and SeeWord, although developed for very different user groups,
uncover some common barriers to computer use. Although some of these
barriers were overcome in similar ways, other solutions were specific
to the target user group and this may suggest strategies that will
be effective in developing inclusive systems in the future.
