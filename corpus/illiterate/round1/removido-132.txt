MULTINET: Enabler for Next Generation Pervasive Wireless Services
Pervasive services provided to the enterprise require from increased
speed, performance, degree of personalization, ubiquitous access
and reliability. 4G broadband wireless systems and multihoming technologies
provide a working framework where such challenges could be met. In
the context of a user driven broadband multimedia service and heterogeneous
multiple-flow communication network supported system, this paper
presents the MULTINET architecture as an enabler for next generation
service delivery. The paper will discuss the main entities involved
in the system, the main functionality supported and performance.
The paper will also highlight initial architecture set-ups and evaluate
benefits and drawbacks of the proposed configurations to meet the
identified QoS requirements.
