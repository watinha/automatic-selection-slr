Evaluating American Sign Language generation through the participation 	of native ASL signers
We discuss important factors in the design of evaluation studies for 	systems that generate animations of American Sign Language (ASL) 	sentences. In particular, we outline how some cultural and linguistic 	characteristics of members of the American Deaf community must be 	taken into account so as to ensure the accuracy of evaluations involving 	these users. Finally, we describe our implementation and user-based 	evaluation (by native ASL signers) of a prototype ASL generator to 	produce sentences containing classifier predicates, frequent and 	complex spatial phenomena that previous ASL generators have not produced.
