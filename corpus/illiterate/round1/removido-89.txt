Mapping users' perspectives and outlining social impacts from digitalization 	of terrestrial TV in Brazil
The digital divide has numerous aspects and is as dynamic as the technology 	industry is able to develop and disseminate new ICTs and services, 	thus increasing or creating new gaps among the more advanced societies 	and those still hampered by social and economic problems. In developing 	countries the diffusion of new technologies is often hindered by 	factors such as insufficient income, deficient infrastructure, cultural 	barriers and lack of information. Brazil is no exception to that 	rule, and all information and communication technologies (ICT) diffusion 	surveys undertaken to date confirm the trend that digital exclusion 	is following the dreadful pattern of social exclusion. The income 	disparities in Brazil are very severe and, also due to the country's 	huge territory and complex geographical and cultural formations, 	a technological innovation is seldom capable of reaching the population 	as a whole and benefiting the entire society. One outstanding exception 	is the terrestrial (free-to-air) TV, which, after about 50 years 	since its introduction, has reached an adoption rate of more than 	90%, and now covers the whole country, with enormous sociocultural 	consequences. In view of this, and with the objective of addressing 	the problem of digital exclusion, the Brazilian Government has devised 	the deployment of digital terrestrial television-DTT-as a singular 	opportunity to reduce the digital divide and to promote the access 	of the population to interactive and citizenship services through 	an already familiar interface, thus avoiding or reducing cultural 	constraints and illiteracy barriers usually posed by other ICTs. 	This study undertakes a comprehensive discussion of that policy and 	its effects, and provides some data to support the strategy: the 	results of two interrelated studies; one that maps TV users' characteristics 	and expectations regarding digital TV, and another that models the 	social network effects on the diffusion of DTT into Brazilian society 	and the users' behavior when facing the new media, namely, an agent-based 	modeling and simulation-ABMS. The model uses the mapping information 	as input to test some hypothetical scenarios in the diffusion process, 	so as to identify factors that affect the overall diffusion process. 	All these studies are in the scope of a broader and deeper methodology 	for ex ante analysis.
