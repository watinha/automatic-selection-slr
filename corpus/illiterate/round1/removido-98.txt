Metaphorical analysis of social factors during information systems 	development
Metaphors have been used widely by researchers for sense making in 	organisations. In this paper, we present the findings of research 	which employs Morgan's metaphors in order to chart the distribution 	of assumptions and social behaviour among Information Systems (IS) 	developers, during IS development and implementation, in a UK National 	Health Service (NHS) organisation. We present the findings of a longitudinal 	interpretive case study. There are a limited number of interpretive 	case studies that look at organisational factors associated with 	systems development, which we regard as an oversight given the extent 	of system failure reported in the IS literature. Our findings highlight 	the predominance of certain metaphors that influence the behaviour 	of key stakeholders involved in IS development. We conclude that 	the use of metaphors for analysis in IS development provides important 	insights into the attitudes and behaviours of key organisational 	stakeholders and reveals the impact of these on the IS development.
