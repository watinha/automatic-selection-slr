The development of a computerised multimedia tutorial system for 	a diverse student population
Higher education institutions are relying less on the matriculation 	marks of prospective students and are implementing computerised testing 	systems in order to test and select students. These institutions 	are assessing and accepting prospective students from a diverse background, 	especially relating to previous exposure to technology and specifically 	in the use of computers. Prospective students with limited or no 	previous exposure in the use of computers and human-computer interfaces 	(HCI) are disadvantaged further when completing computerised admission 	tests. A computerised multimedia tutorial system (ACCUTUT) was developed 	in order to train prospective students in the use of computerised 	admission test user interfaces. This paper discussed the development 	of ACCUTUT and shows that the use of such a computerised multimedia 	tutorial system can eliminate most user interface problems experienced 	by prospective students when completing computerised admission tests.
