Designing e-learning games for rural children in India: a format 	for balancing learning with fun
Poor literacy remains a barrier to economic empowerment in the developing 	world. Of particular importance is fluency in a widely spoken "world 	language" such as English, which is typically a second language for 	these low-income learners. We make the case that mobile games on 	cellphones is an appropriate solution in the typical ecologies of 	developing regions. The challenge is to design e-learning games that 	are both educational and pleasurable for our target learners, who 	have limited familiarity with high technology. We propose the receptive-practice-activation 	cycle that could be used as the conceptual model for the designs. 	We then report how this format could be refined, based on our experiences 	in the field with three games that have collectively undergone nine 	rounds of iterations. In particular, it appears that maintaining 	a distinction between learning and fun to some extent is necessary 	for effective designs.
