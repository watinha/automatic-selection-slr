Automated Visual Presentation: From Heterogeneous Information to
Coherent Visual Discourse
Automated visual presentation systems should be able to design effective
presentations for heterogeneous (quantitative and qualitative) information.
They should also be able to work in static or interactive environments
and capable of employing a wide range of visual media and visual
techniques. In this paper, we focus on three tasks in building visual
production systems: establishing a thorough understanding of the
presentation-related characteristics of domain-specific information;
classifying several types of visual information and capturing their
distinct syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features; and formulating
a set of design principles.


We define a data-analysis taxonomy to characterize heterogeneous information.
In addition, we have modeled presentation context information such
as audience identity to produce user-centered visual design. To utilize
and manipulate visual information, we have classified it into visual
objects and visual tools based on its role in the visual production
process. To guide the visual design process, we have formulated a
set of design principles that ensure the expressiveness and effectiveness
of a design. To test and evaluate our work, we have developed a prototype
system called IMPROVISE based on the research results. We use examples
generated by IMPROVISE to illustrate how it constructs visual presentations.
