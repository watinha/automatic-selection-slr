A neural network, speech-based approach to literacy
An automatic word recognition system is described which assists orally
proficient literacy inefficient people to become literate within
a minimum possible timeframe. The system enables people with a strong
oral tradition to impart their stories directly in text form, without
the assistance of a learning facilitator, which is the current best
practice for such people. This project stems from work with indigenous
communities, but has far-reaching repercussions beyond this community
sector, with the potential for benefit to mainstream literacy education
(Gluck et.al., 1999). It should be emphasized that our system differs
from virtually all other speech-to-text recognition systems in that
users are not required to interact via written text (e.g. Kohonen,
1988); at the heart of the system is a neural network-based pattern
recognizer which translates speech patterns into visual rather than
textual cues. Results obtained to date using this system are reported.
