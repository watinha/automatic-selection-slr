Information access for visually impaired persons: do we still keep
a “document” in “documentation”?
At the same time that global economies and multimedia technologies
provide impetus for increasingly visual communication, the information
needs of persons with limited vision may require communication to
shift from graphics back to text, or on to audio or tactile forms.
To understand documentation issues related to this shift, one must
understand the varied forms of visual impairment, available assistive
technologies, and the resultant design considerations. Efforts to
prepare more effective materials for visually impaired users may
yield “universal design” benefits by identifying and reducing sources
of confusion for all users
