A growth theory perspective on the international diffusion of e-commerce
This research explores the reasons why electronic commerce practices
have diffused around the world at the national level of analysis,
due to forces that are both internal and external to the countries
in which diffusion is observed to occur. We propose two related growth
theories that contribute contrasting viewpoints about the origins
of the drivers of diffusion: endogenous growth theory and exogenous
growth theory. We use the former theory to argue that the primary
drivers of diffusion stem from economic forces that are internal
to a country, including its government policies (e.g., tax on online
stores), wealth, infrastructure, readiness, education levels, and
so on. The latter theory suggests that the primary drivers are external
to the economy, and may reflect the forces present in the regional
economy, international drivers of technological change, trade flows
and so on. We explore the efficacy of these alternative perspectives
in a set of propositions for the drivers of national-level diffusion
of e-commerce that spans developed and developing nations.
