e-du box: educational multimedia with tangible-enhanced interaction
Media resources usage has significant impact on children literacy
in the first school years in Brazil [5]. Computer software and tangible
interfaces can help engage pupils in effective learning activities.
Tangible interfaces built with familiar objects of our everyday lives
such as wood and tissues are well accepted by pupils. In this work,
we detail our design and evaluation of e-du box -- an educational,
authoring and sharing multimedia platform including a tangible companion
that provides feedback for users. We employed a participatory design
process based on providing supports intended to help children engage
in different tasks. We could elicit a list of design guidelines for
this specific application. We discuss our experience with this design
approach and explore its implications.
