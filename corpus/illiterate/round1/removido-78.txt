Dimensions of adaptivity in mobile systems: personality and people's
attitudes
In this work, we present a study about adaptation on a mobile museum
guide aiming at investigating the relationships between personality
traits and the attitudes toward some basic dimensions of adaptivity.
Each participant was exposed to two simulated systems that realized
an adaptive and a non-adaptive version, respectively, on each of
the dimensions investigated. The study showed interesting effects
of Big Five personality traits on acceptance of the adaptivity dimensions;
in particular conscientiousness, creativity and stability. Locus
of control seemed to have a limited yet quite selective effect on
delegating to the system the choice of follow-ups.
