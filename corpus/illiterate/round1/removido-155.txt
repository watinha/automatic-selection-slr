Information and Communication Technologies Usage by Students in an
Israeli High School: Equity, Gender, and Inside/Outside School Learning
Issues
This study describes and analyses a survey that was conducted with
384 students from grades 7â€“12 in a typical urban High School in Israel.
The students reported on the extent and characteristics of Information
and Communication Technology (ICT) usage within and beyond school
time and location. Its focus is on (a) equity issues regarding the
extent, purposes and scope of ICT usage and students self perception
in ICT proficiency; (b) gender and age differences in ICT use; and
(c) relationship between inside/outside school learning processes.
The findings show that 10% of the students are non-users of ICT,
two thirds are common-users and only 25% are skilled users. About
half of the students use the Internet to some extent. Major Gender
differences were found: in general, more boys used ICT more extensively
than girls did. Differences among age groups were found mainly with
respect to the use of complex applications, but not regarding Internet
usage. These results are discussed in the light of the three focal
issues: equity, gender, and integration of learning processes taking
place within and outside school.
