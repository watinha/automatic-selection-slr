The global digital divide in the Internet: developed countries constructs
and Third World realities
Defined as the differential degree to which rich and poor countries
benefit from new information and communications technologies such
as the Internet, the global digital divide is widely measured by
international institutions in terms of the number of persons with
individual access to those technologies. Yet, while this measure
makes sense in the rich countries, where individual ownership is
widespread among the population, it makes very little sense in poor
countries. For, in the latter, what we find is that although individual
access is indeed very limited, a remarkable number of local innovations
ensure that the benefits of the Internet are made available to at
least 10 million people throughout the Third World. Many such persons
are illiterate, unskilled and resident in the rural areas of developing
countries. These findings directly contradict the commonly held notion
that there are few, if any, local innovations in the applications
of the Internet outside the rich countries and those parts of poorer
countries with close connections to the former (most typically through
multinational corporations). From a policy point of view, we suggest
that foreign aid donors and national governments pay less attention
to providing individual access facilities such as so-called telecentres
and focus instead on ways to foster indigenous rural innovation systems
devoted to finding relevant and cost-effective applications of the
Internet.
