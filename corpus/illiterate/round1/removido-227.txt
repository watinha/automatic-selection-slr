A new driving force behind capacity building in Africa: group support
systems
This paper explores, through a number of case studies, the application
of group support systems for capacity building initiatives in various
sectors in Africa. A model is introduced on the adoption of GSS in
an African context. Notwithstanding skeptical expectations with respect
to the successful application of the technology, the results clearly
indicate that: there is support from key participants and top managers
to use the technology; computer illiteracy does not seem to hinder
successful GSS application; electronic communication does not get
in the way of the traditional verbal meeting culture; and participants
were very satisfied with the technology, the process, and the results
of the electronic meetings. The case studies show the potential of
applying GSS to give new momentum to capacity building and capacity
mobilization efforts in Africa
