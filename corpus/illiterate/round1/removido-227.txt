The effect of data set characteristics on the choice of clustering 	validity index type
Clustering techniques are widely used to give insight about the similarities/dissimilarities 	between data set items. Most algorithms require the user to tune 	parameters such as number of clusters or threshold for cut-off point 	in a dendrogram. Such parameters also affect the clustering quality. 	In a good quality cluster, the intra-cluster similarity should be 	high, whereas the inter-cluster similarity should be low. To determine 	the optimal cluster number, several cluster validity methods have 	been proposed. However, there is no guideline with respect to which 	clustering validity methods can be used in conjunction with which 	clustering algorithms. In this paper, Dunn and SD validity indices 	were applied to Kohonen self organizing maps, k-means and agglomerative 	clustering algorithms and their limitations were shown empirically.
