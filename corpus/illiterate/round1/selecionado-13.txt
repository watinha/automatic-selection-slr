Designing desirability in an augmentative and alternative communication
device
This paper discusses work carried in the context of a study addressing
the design and development of a wearable communication aid for people
who are illiterate and cannot speak. People with such disabilities
often depend on electronic augmentative and alternative communication
devices for interpersonal communication. A central theme of the paper,
however, is that such products, and products intended for people
with disabilities more generally, have characteristics that inadequately
attend to users’ needs—in particular many devices pay insufficient
regard to the psychological and sociological impact the devices have
upon their users. The paper briefly discusses an empirical case study
targeted to design and develop the Portland Communication Aid (PCA).
The process of establishing user requirements, and in particular
the notion of designer-facilitated participatory design, is discussed.
The resulting prototype of the PCA is briefly explained along with
a discussion of the importance of product semantics in the design
of assistive technology.
