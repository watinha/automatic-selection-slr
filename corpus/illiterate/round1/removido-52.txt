Prospects of e-government implementation in Nigeria
E-governance is a democratic practice that is gradually gaining universal
acceptance and applicability. It refers to a governmental type aimed
at achieving effective service delivery from government to citizens,
moving governance from traditionalist bureaucratization to modernist
participatory administration. This paper is situated within the global
experience, where many countries have advanced in their practice
of e-governance and Nigeria, as a nation cannot relish in the disadvantages
of being left behind in a globalizing world. We strongly propose
that there is a significant relationship between a country's technological,
political and bureaucratic advancement and a successful e-governance
practice. This paper argues that with the present poor state of social
infrastructure (especially power supply and road network) in Nigeria,
the practice of e-governance is most likely to be negatively impacted
upon. On this note, our paper recommends a re-assessment of the country's
state of e-governance preparedness. It recommends the application
of proactive steps aimed at ensuring the adequate supply of electricity
and the development of human resource capabilities of the populace
with the aim of achieving high-level computer literacy. The interval
convocation of stakeholders at Abuja for talk-shops is not enough.
Rather, Internet facilities and services must of necessity be made
easily accessible at the lowest cost, to all Nigerians, irrespective
of how remote their locations in the country may be. The world is
on the move and Nigeria is an integral part of it, hence, should
not lag behind.
