Rangoli: a visual phonebook for low-literate users
In developing countries, language and literacy are barriers that prevent 	many people from using simple applications like a phonebook on mobile 	phones. The traditional, alphabetical organization is not good enough 	for low-literate users who either do not know or have forgotten the 	alphabetical order of any script. We propose Rangoli, a phonebook 	that explores several ideas. It organizes contacts in nine colour 	'pages'. On each page nine icons are displayed in that colour. A 	contact is associated with a colour and an icon. Any contact can 	be accessed by pressing only two buttons on the number-pad. The spatial 	location of each contact does not change even as the phonebook fills 	up. The limitation of 81 contacts is not a major problem for these 	users for now. Rangoli was first conceived during a class project 	and was improved through iterations of user study, design and evaluation.
