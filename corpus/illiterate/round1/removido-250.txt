Extending prerendered-interface voting software to support accessibility 	and other ballot features
This work builds on the prerendered user interface (PRUI) approach 	for high-assurance voting software with a new design that supports 	synchronized audio and visual output, as well as concurrent input 	from a touchscreen and an alternate input device. This new design 	offers access for voters with a range of disabilities while retaining 	the benefits of PRUI voting systems: the user interface can be independently 	designed and audited, and the software needing verification is much 	smaller and simpler. This paper discusses the challenges of supporting 	accessibility in this architecture, explains how these challenges 	were addressed, and describes the resulting design. To demonstrate 	the feasibility of this approach and to establish a point of reference 	for the simplicity of voting machine software, this design has been 	implemented as a program called Pvote, in 460 lines of Python.
