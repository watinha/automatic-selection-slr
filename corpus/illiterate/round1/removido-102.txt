Generalized spreadsheet for CACSD
This paper presents an approach for a computer aided control system
design (CACSD) software that is based on an extension of the spread-sheet
metaphor. The spreadsheet are extended in two ways: the contents
of the cells are abstract objects that can be manipulated directly,
and the relations between the objects are bidirectional. Prototype
implementations have been made in Matlab. The idea is illustrated
by several small tools that illuminate various aspects of control
system design
