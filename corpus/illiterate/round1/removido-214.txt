Human values and the future of technology: a declaration of responsibility
We can make a difference in shaping the future by ensuring that computers 	"serve human needs (Mumford, 1934)." By making explicit the enduring 	values that we hold dear we can guide computer system designers and 	developers for the next decade, century, and thereafter. After setting 	our high-level goals we can pursue the components and seek the process 	for fulfilling them. High-level goals might include peace, excellent 	health care, adequate nutrition, accessible education, communication, 	freedom of expression, support for creative exploration, safety, 	and socially constructive entertainment. Computer technology can 	help attain these high-level goals if we clearly state measurable 	objectives, obtain participation of professionals, and design effective 	human-computer interfaces. Design considerations include adequate 	attention to individual differences among users, support of social 	and organizational structures, design for reliability and safety, 	provision of access by the elderly, handicapped, or illiterate, and 	appropriate user controlled adaptation. With suitable theories and 	empirical research we can achieve ease of learning, rapid performance, 	low error rates, and good retention over time, while preserving high 	subjective satisfaction. To raise the consciousness of designers 	and achieve these goals, we must generate an international debate, 	stimulate discussions within organizations, and interact with other 	intellectual communities. This paper calls for a focus on the "you" 	and "I" in developing improved user interface (UI) research and systems, 	offers a Declaration of Responsibility, and proposes a Social Impact 	Statement for major computing projects.
