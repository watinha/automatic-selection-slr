Youth and the Internet: Uses and practices in the home
The aim of the present research was to examine the relationship between
Greek young people aged 12-18 and the Internet through their patterns
of Internet use in the home. A particular objective of the study
was the investigation of the possible effects of social stratification,
gender and age on their domestic Internet use. A sample of 418 high
school students selected from 17 schools in four Greek cities completed
a structured self-reported questionnaire primarily concerned with
Internet use (frequency, purpose and behaviour patterns) at home
and the types of the parental supervision. The research was carried
out during the period 2004-2005. The main findings of the study were
the following: (a) Internet access remains at a very low level and
is insufficiently used for school purposes, (b) younger students
(aged 12-15 years) use it more frequently than older ones for information
seeking concerning school work, (c) the Internet is an indicator
of social and economic stratification since most young people with
access to it come from family environments with a higher educational
and socioeconomic background and live in urban and semi urban areas,
(d) boys make up the majority of systematic users, mainly for entertainment
purposes, (e) the Internet is a place and space safeguarding the
''privacy'' of young people with the majority of them preferring
to surf alone, (f) parental supervision and monitoring seems to be
absent largely from the relationship between youth and the Internet,
and (g) in general, the frequency and type of Internet use are not
significantly affected by students' places of residence or the educational
level and profession of their parents.
