Community knowledge sharing: an Internet application to support communications 	across literacy levels
This paper presents Community Knowledge Sharing (CKS), an asynchronous 	discussion system designed for use in the developing world. CKS supports 	community development by allowing communities to interact, share 	and learn from each other. Recognizing that large segments of the 	population in rural communities have low levels of literacy, CKS 	implements a multi-literate design in which the system can be customized 	based on the abilities and preferences of the user. An evaluation 	of CKS, conducted in a rural agricultural community in the Dominican 	Republic, found that low literate users prefer fully iconic interfaces. 	Future systems designed for use by people with a range of literacy 	skills must ensure that iconic interfaces provide users with the 	audio and visual cues they need to work effectively
