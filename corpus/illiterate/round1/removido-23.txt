Information Technology Competence of Business Managers: A Definition
and Research Model
This research explores the concept of the information technology (IT)
competence of business managers, defined as the set of IT-related
explicit and tacit knowledge that a business manager possesses that
enables him or her to exhibit IT leadership in his or her area of
business. A manager's knowledge of technologies, applications, systems
development, and management of IT form his or her explicit IT knowledge.
This domain further extends to include knowing who knows what, which
enables the manager to leverage the knowledge of others. Tacit IT
knowledge is conceptualized as a combination of experience and cognition.
Experience relates to personal computing, IT projects, and overall
management of IT. Cognition refers to two mental models: the managerâ€™s
process view and his or her vision for the role of IT. The outcomes
expected from IT-competent business managers are chiefly two behaviors:
an increased willingness to form partnerships with IT people and
an increased propensity to lead and participate in IT projects.
