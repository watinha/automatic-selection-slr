A psycho\&\#45;pedagogical approach to m\&\#45;learning in a developing\&\#45;world 	context
A study of the potential of mobile learning (m-learning) to contribute 	to the development in a typical rapidly developing country (Iran) 	is presented. Established educational theories are applied in order 	to classify potential modalities for m-learning: sample surveys of 	the reactions of typical user groups were taken and analysed. It 	is concluded that m-learning will be the best to be executed within 	the informal framework of learning, not only supplementing the school 	curriculum, but also extending powerfully into lifelong learning, 	especially for isolated rural/agricultural communities. It is further 	concluded that the standard mobile phone is, and will continue for 	some time to be, the dominant platform.
