Giving meaning to measurement
Measurement provides the transformation that represents the relationship
between one domain and another. Measurement in isolation is meaningless.
It must fit into the understanding of a system, which has relational,
interacting components. Measurement always has a reference from which
it establishes a relationship between domains. We have a colloquial
expression in America, “Don't miss the forest for the trees.” It
means that by focusing on the details, we tend to overlook the big
picture. Sometimes scientists and engineers can see the details but
miss the overall perspective. This does not have to be. We can overcome
this failing and thereby build more useful instruments. We need to
understand who uses measurement, why we measure, and how we measure.
Upon this basis we can use basic principles of human interactions
to construct better, more useful instruments. You might call these
basic principles ergonomics, user interface, human factors; I would
call it common sense
