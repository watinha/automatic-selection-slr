Inside the source selection process: Selection criteria for human 	information sources
Co-workers are an important source of information in organizations. 	Consequently, information managers seek to facilitate the use of 	such human information sources. Although various studies about what 	influences the use of human information sources in organizations 	exist, it is difficult for information managers to utilize insights 	from this research body. The studies have provided contradictory 	results regarding the role of accessibility and quality and suffer 	from various weaknesses. To address these weaknesses, several studies 	are employing other research methods. This study aims to contribute 	to the methodological development of this emerging new line of research 	by exploring the value of a think aloud approach to such studies. 	In addition, it aims to provide more insight into the role of accessibility 	and quality in the selection of human information sources in organizations. 	Fifty-six employees from four governmental organizations were asked 	to think aloud while selecting human information sources. The findings 	of this study corroborate those of studies taking a similar approach: 	source quality is the most dominant factor in the selection of human 	information sources. The think aloud approach seems a valuable contribution 	to available research methods to assess the role of accessibility 	and quality in human source selection in organizations.
