Decision support engineering: a DSS development methodology
Current DSS research has demonstrated the viability of DSSs which 	provide active support, are knowledge based, promote creativity, 	and could act as tools for organizing thoughts. Very few of these 	promising approaches have been tried out in practice for real-life 	situations. One of the important reasons for this gap in state-of-the-art 	DSS research and practice is the need for a comprehensive DSS development 	methodology. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology based 	on a life cycle model and encompassing an engineering approach to 	DSS development. This approach assumes that functionality of a DSS 	is a process of negotiation between the user and the builder, and 	focusses on the support provided by a DSS, as this is the basic reason 	for DSS development. As an engineering approach, it establishes the 	standard for the level of support to be provided by the proposed 	DSS in terms of task effectiveness and resource requirements. This 	engineering approach has been used in a number of DSS development 	projects and has produced successful DSS products
