Mobile phones may be the right devices for supporting developing
world accessibility, but is the WWW the right service delivery model?
In this paper we detail the synergies we have observed between the
features and limitations of mobile phones, and the usability and
accessibility requirements of rural developing world users. This
includes support for sequential interaction, multimedia input and
output, asynchronous messaging and a universally familiar numeric
keypad. However, we argue that the WWW as currently conceived may
be an inappropriate model for delivering mobile information services
in this context. We highlight a number of tensions we have observed
between the traditional web model, and the design synergies that
we have uncovered. To demonstrate an alternative framework, we describe
CAM --- a platform for delivering mobile information services in
the rural developing world. Supporting scripted execution, media-driven,
tangible interaction as well as an offline usage model, CAM is uniquely
adapted both to rural accessibility requirements and the inherent
capabilities of mobile phones. By learning from the CAM design, we
can either improve the design of existing mobile web standards and
services, or implement a more appropriate framework altogether.
