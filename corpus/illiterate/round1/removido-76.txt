A bridging design prototype for investigating concept mapping in
the preschool community
This paper reports on studies where teachers from two different preschools
incorporated a Bridging Design Prototype (BDP) for concept mapping
into classroom activities. Designed under inclusive, participatory,
and user-centered principles, the BDP was used to perform observations
for assessing an interaction problem and refining the user community
profile. The observation findings will inform next stage of product
development.
