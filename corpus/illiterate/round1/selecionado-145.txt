Man-computer interaction aspects in systems for the young people 	and non-alphabetized adults
The INFormar project (Informatics for the Education of the Illiterate 	Young and Adult) unfolds in a country with a huge social exclusion 	by illiteracy. The project main target is to develop customized computational 	and methodological tools that multiply the processes of teaching 	illiterate adults and of training specialized teachers, at the same 	time helping the process of digital inclusion. The first of the tools 	assesses the individual illiteracy level and gives some insight for 	an analysis of the special aspects of human-computer interface in 	computer systems for illiterate users.
