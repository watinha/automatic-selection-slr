Text-free user interfaces for illiterate and semiliterate users
We describe work toward the goal of a user interface (UI) designed
such that even novice, illiterate users require absolutely no intervention
from anyone at all to use. Our text-free UI is based on many hours
of ethnographic design conducted in collaboration with a community
of illiterate domestic laborers in three Bangalore slums. An ethnographic
design process was used to understand what kind of application subjects
would be interested in, how they respond to computing technology,
and how they react to specific UI elements. We built two applications
using these principles, one for job search for domestic laborers
and another for a generic map that could be used for navigating a
city. The resulting designs are based on key lessons that we gained
through the design process. This article describes the design process,
the design principles, which evolved out of the process, the final
application designs, and results from initial user testing. Our results
confirm previous work that emphasizes the need for semiabstracted
graphics and voice feedback, but we additionally find that some aspects
of design for illiterate users that have been previously overlooked
(such as a consistent help feature). Results also show that the text-free
designs are strongly preferred over standard text-based interfaces
by the communities which we address and that they are potentially
able to bring even complex computer functions within the reach of
users who are unable to read.
