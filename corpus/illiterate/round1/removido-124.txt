Creating a realistic context for team projects in HCI
Team projects are nowadays common practice in HCI education. This 	paper focuses on the role of clients and users in team projects in 	introductory HCI courses. In order to provide projects with a realistic 	context we invite people from industry to serve as clients for the 	student teams. Some of them have a professional interest in participating 	in our course and define a project themselves. Another way we make 	projects realistic is to have teams evaluate their designs with real 	users.We describe how we incorporate the role of clients and users 	in our courses and describe our experiences. One of the results of 	our evaluations is that most students find it very interesting and 	stimulating to work with a client on a 'real' project from industry.
