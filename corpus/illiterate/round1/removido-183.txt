Real time road sign recognition system using artificial neural networks
for bengali textual information box
An Automated Road Sign Recognition system using Artificial Neural
Network for the Textual Information box inscribing in Bengali is
presented in this paper. The system captures real time images every
two seconds and saves them as JPG format files. The system processes
the images to find out whether they contain images of road signs
or not. The textual information of the road signs is detected and
extracted from the images. The Bengali OCR system takes the textual
information as an input to recognize individual Bengali characters.
The Bengali OCR is implemented using Multi layer Perceptron. The
output of the Bengali OCR system is compared with the previously
enrolled standard Bengali textual road signs. The throughput which
comes from the matching process is used as input for the speech synthesizer
and finally the system delivers the audio stream to the driver, either
in Bengali or in English based on the user settings. After testing
this system, the obtained accuracy rate was evaluated at 91.48%.
