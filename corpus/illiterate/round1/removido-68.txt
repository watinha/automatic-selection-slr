Interactive Speech Translation in the Diplomat Project
The Diplomat rapid-deployment speech-translation system is intended
to allow na√Ø ve users to communicate across a language barrier, without
strong domain restrictions, despite the error-prone nature of current
speech and translation technologies. In addition, it should be deployable
for new languages an order of magnitude more quickly than traditional
technologies. Achieving this ambitious set of goals depends in large
part on allowing the users to correct recognition and translation
errors interactively. We present the Multi-Engine Machine Translation
(MEMT) architecture, describing how it is well suited for such an
application. We then discuss our approaches to rapid-deployment speech
recognition and synthesis. Finally we describe our incorporation
of interactive error correction throughout the system design. We
have already developed working bidirectional Croatian &lrarr2; English
and Spanish &lrarr2; English systems, and have Haitian Creole &lrarr2;
English and Korean &lrarr2; English versions under development.
