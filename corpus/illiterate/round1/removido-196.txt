The non-technical person as technical writer/editor and documentation
for the computer illiterate
University computer center personnel know there is no dearth of documentation
designed for the expert. Control Data, UNIVAC, DEC—;even IBM— paper
and fiche all possible areas. IBM's latest Marketing Publications
KWIC Index alone contains 60 pages (double columns, reduced print)
of titles...an ample supply of words, even for rabid manualpeople.
No, the documentation problem which faces User Services groups in
academic installations is how best to provide information to the
non-expert: the new, naive user; the pseudo-sophisticate who comes
on strong with highly-specialized terms like “keypunch” and “listing”,
the Director of User Services—in other words, the various types of
true computer illiterate This paper respectfully suggests that it
is possible to employ a person with no technical training as a technical
writer/editor within a university computer center environment, and
that such an individual can prove amazingly effective in helping
User Services to attack this sometimes menial, always demanding task.
