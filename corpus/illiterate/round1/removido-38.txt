REALITY in Home Telecare: A Systemic Approach to Evaluation
This paper describes the REALITY telecare system, designed to enable
a range of commonly occurring chronic diseases to be managed in the
home setting. This uses hand-held computers linked to the internet
for collecting and transmitting clinical and quality of life data
and providing remote clinical advice. Key to the success of such
telecare is a proper scheme of evaluation. An overall framework for
such evaluation is proposed. Within this schema formative evaluation
results are presented, focusing particularly on technical issues
being addressed, patient recruitment and retention, and data collection.
User acceptability is then considered as a first ingredient of summative
evaluation
