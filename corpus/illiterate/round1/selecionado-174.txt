Design studies for a financial management system for micro-credit 	groups in rural india
In this paper we describe the design process, results and observations 	obtained in designing a user interface for managing community-based 	financial institutions in rural India. The primary users are semi-literate 	village women from local communities. We present detailed observations 	from our field visits and the resulting evolution in our design vision. 	We describe a successful design artifact that is the result of this 	process, and list several important features that contributed to 	its success. We conclude with the current state of our work and our 	plans for the future.
