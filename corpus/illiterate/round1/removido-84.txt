A web accessibility service: update and findings
We report here on our progress on a project first described at the
ASSETS 2002 conference. At that time, we had developed a prototype
system in which a proxy server intermediary was used to adapt Web
pages to meet the needs of older adults. Since that report, we field
tested the prototype and learned of problems with the proxy approach.
We report on the lessons learned from that work and on our new approach
towards meeting the Web needs of older adults and users with disabilities.
This new software makes adaptations on the client machine, with greater
accuracy and speed than was possible with the proxy server approach.
It transforms Web pages "on the fly", without requiring that all
Web content be re-written. The new software has been in use for a
year and we report here on our findings from the usage. We discuss
this approach in the context of Web accessibility standards and Web
usability.
