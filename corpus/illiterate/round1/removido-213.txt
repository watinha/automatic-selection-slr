A cost-effective solution for telemedicine in rural health care using
mobile ad hoc networks
Information and communication technology carries with it enormous
potential for transforming poor people's lives, connecting them to
markets and improving their access to government services. Health
care organizations are also utilizing different information system
technologies that can be employed to reduce administrative costs,
make organizations more competitive, and ultimately provide better
care to patients. However, most of the existing health care solutions
require a huge initial investment and require the end-users to be
technology-aware enough to use them. Developing economies like those
in Latin America, Africa and Asia cannot afford to deploy such kind
of real-time technologies for its masses because this would not be
financially feasible. This paper discusses the problems associated
with the implementation of such solutions in the rural sector of
such economies. Also, a new system has been proposed which makes
use of the wireless ad hoc networking for rural health care management.
It has a lot of attractive features like ease of setup, use, and
maintenance; and, most important, relatively very low cost for both
users and providers. Also a case study of a similar kind of successful
e-governance project in India, Bhoomi is shown which provides support
for the promises associated with the proposed system.
