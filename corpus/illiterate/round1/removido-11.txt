Information flows for meaningful implementation of the promotion 	of administrative justice act of South Africa
The Promotion of Administrative Justice Act of South Africa (AJA) 	requires administrators to provide those who have been negatively 	affected by a decision with reasonable explanations if these are 	requested. Fair and accountable administration is identified as a 	basic constitutional right in South Africa. However, ensuring that 	state departments can provide information on request to even remote 	and poorly resourced citizens is a major undertaking and, other than 	taking grievances to court, it is difficult to initiate, respond 	to and monitor the process. The information flows pose the most significant 	challenges. An investigation is underway into how rural Communities 	can use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to access 	this right. Sen's Capabilities Approach is used to relate the role 	of ICT to an expansion of the capabilities of individuals and communities, 	which translates into them acquiring genuine options to access their 	constitutional right. The research has already involved interviewing 	representatives from a number of groups. This was done to identify 	the possible information flows, end-user requirements and social 	and individual constraints. The paper proposes an information flow 	incorporating facilitators and a 'clearing house' in addition to 	the citizens and administrators.
