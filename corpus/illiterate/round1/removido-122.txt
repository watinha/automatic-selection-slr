Barriers to e-commerce and competitive business models in developing
countries: A case study
This paper integrates and extends research on e-commerce in the developing
world. We use three categories of feedback systems-economic, sociopolitical
and cognitive-to offer a simple model of e-commerce barriers in the
developing world. We also examine characteristics of e-business models
that can be successfully employed in developing countries. Then,
we provide the case of an e-business model followed by a Nepal-based
multiple international award winning online provider. This paper's
theoretical contribution is to explain the 'hows' and 'whys' of e-commerce
in developing countries and to identify clear contexts and attendant
mechanism.
