Communications Policy and Information Technology: Promises, Problems,
Prospects
New technologies, although developed with optimism, often fall short
of their predicted potential and create new problems. Communications
technologies are no different. Their utopian proponents claim that
universal access to advanced communications technologies can help
to feed the hungry, cure the sick, educate the illiterate, improve
the global standard of living, and ultimately bring about world peace.
The sobering reality is that while communications technologies have
a role to play in making the world a better place, the impact of
any specific technological advance is likely to be modest.


The limitations of new technologies are often not inherent in the
technologies themselves but the result of regulatory or economic
constraints. While the capability may exist to deliver any information
anywhere in the world, many people lack the money to pay for it,
the equipment to access it, the skills to use it, or even the knowledge
that it might be useful to them. This book examines the complex ways
in which communication technologies and policies affect the people
whose lives they are intended to improve. The areas of discussion
include Internet regulation, electronic voting and petitioning, monopoly
and competition in communications markets, the future of wireless
communications, and the concept of universal service.
