An Interface Design Methodology: Scenario Based Design Extended for
Diverse Computer User Groups
The purpose of this work is to begin development of a culturally valid
interface design process. This process would benefit interface designers
and design companies by providing a model that facilitates design
for special user populations (e.g., the educationally underserved).
Discussion in this paper centers on merging (1) an accepted interface
design process in the HCI community, (2) various elicitation methods
for determining user needs and (3) noted design considerations for
marginalized groups such as the economically/educationally underserved
in the United States. The acculturalization model discussed here
is an extension of Rosson and Carroll's (2002) scenario based development
(SBD) user-centered interface design approach. In SBD, scenarios
are developed and analyzed to assist designers with requirements
analysis, system functionality, information presentation, interactions
methods, documentation, and the design of the prototypes and the
usability evaluations. SBD employs three major phases: analysis,
design, and prototype and evaluation
