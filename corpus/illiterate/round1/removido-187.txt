The aAQUA Approach: Innovative Web 2.0 Tools for Developing Countries
As in many regions of the world, people in rural India often lack
access to knowledge that's more readily available to people in urban
areas. Although rural telecenters are becoming more common, developing
content that's presented in local languages, relevant to users, and
delivered in an immediately usable form is a challenge here and in
rural areas across the globe. To address this, an agricultural portal
for rural farmers in India uses innovative database systems and information
retrieval techniques. In so doing, it both improves service and addresses
connection costs and constraints.
