A visualization design repository for mobile devices
Mobile devices with multimedia and graphics capabilities have great 	potential in a wide variety of applications. In addition to location-based 	services, mobile-commerce and multimedia entertainment that are often 	viewed as promising applications of third generation mobile networks 	mobile devices also offer a potential solution to bridging the digital 	divide in developing countries. Mobile devices could be used to provide 	essential IT services like internet access, communication, information, 	education and banking in areas where no fully developed infrastructures 	like the electric grid and wire-based net connections are available. 	Highly usable interfaces will be a critical factor in the development 	of successful mobile devices and applications. This is especially 	true if such IT services should become accessible to illiterate or 	semi-literate users and users without any previous computer experience 	where the interface will have to rely largely on graphics and speech 	as interaction mechanisms. However, the design of multimedia-based 	interfaces for mobile devices is currently complicated by a lack 	of standardized visualization techniques and interaction mechanisms 	and the absence of related component libraries and style guides. 	As a first step towards the development of a standardized set of 	device-independent presentation and interaction techniques we are 	currently working on a repository of visualization design solutions 	for mobile UIs which will later be extended to include general interaction 	techniques.
