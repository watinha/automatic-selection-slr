Using a handheld PC to collect and analyze observational data
Observational research has become an increasingly important tool in 	the technical communicator's toolkit as a way of analyzing audiences, 	discovering problems with current documentation systems, and envisioning 	alternate ways to design information. Whether it is used informally, 	in structured design methods, or in academic workplace studies, observational 	research is useful for technical communication. Yet collecting, managing, 	and analyzing data can be laborious, time-consuming, and hard to 	share among team members. Thus technical communicators sometimes 	avoid observational research in favor of interviews, focus groups, 	and usability testing -- methods that have their own strengths, but 	that are no substitute for observational research.In this presentation, 	I describe two projects in which I dealt with some of these barriers 	by using handheld PCs (a Handspring Visor and a Sharp Zaurus) as 	data collection, management, and analysis tools. Consolidating various 	techniques to a handheld PC -particularly on the data collection 	side -- leads to a number of benefits, including a reduction in laborious 	manual transcription; the easy transfer from raw data to research 	databases; the elimination of work in digitizing audio and photo 	data for archiving in a database; on-the-fly analysis of data anywhere, 	without the need for file cabinets, folders, or other bulky types 	of data storage; and easy sharing of data among team members. At 	the presentation's conclusion, I will describe how I plan to further 	develop this fruitful line of inquiry by developing a crossplatform 	qualitative research tool.
