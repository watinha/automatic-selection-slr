A human-centered semantic navigation system for indoor environments
In this paper we discuss the very important issue of indoor location
services. Location services have been in use, and studied, for a
long time in mobile networks. With the proliferation of wireless
networking technologies, users are mostly interested in advanced
services that render the surrounding environment (i.e., the building)
highly intelligent and significantly facilitate user activities (pervasive
computing paradigm). Our focus is on navigation, one of the most
important location services. Existing approaches for indoor navigation
are driven by geometric information and neglect important aspects
like the semantics of points/areas and user preferences. The derived
applications are not intelligent enough to catalytically contribute
to the pervasive computing vision. In this paper, a novel navigation
mechanism is introduced. Such navigation scheme is enriched with
user profiles and the adoption of an ontological framework. These
enhancements introduce a series of technical challenges that are
extensively discussed throughout the paper.
