Token-based peer-to-peer interaction coordination
The rapid emergence of Electronic Commerce has caused a so-called
“digital divide” to form between those with access to the Internet
and those without. While governments have tried to lessen this divide
through the introduction of public access points and infrastructure
subsidies, little is being done to address the barriers to entry
for functionally illiterate and cognitively impaired populations.
Our research attempts to address this issue by individualizing end-user
interactions with computerized systems on a domain-specific basis.
We take the view that each end-user's system should act as a peer
in the computing environment, allowing end-users to own and control
their information. Shifting from the current client-server computing
environment to the peer-to-peer paradigm of computing should facilitate
the customization of interactions that these populations require
while maintaining their privacy. Existing applications programming
environments are geared towards the client-server model of computing.
Research into peer-to-peer application development has indicated
that the process-oriented programming environment facilitates some
aspects of peer-to-peer application development, but introduces challenges
with respect to distributed data management. Existing blocking distributed
transaction coordination mechanisms rely on global state to facilitate
centralized control of distributed resources, but there is no concept
of global state in the process-oriented model. This thesis introduces
a new model of token-based peer-to-peer interaction coordination
(the TPIC model). This new model maintains consistency in a peer-to-peer
environment without relying on global state.
