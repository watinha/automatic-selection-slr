Digital literacy: Problems faced by telecenter users in Mexico
This article explores the problems that Internet users of marginalized 	populations face at telecenters (Internet public access sites). Using 	an exploratory case study method and gathering data from users and 	telecenter operators, we have explored users' limitations when using 	the Internet. To interpret the results, this article uses the digital 	literacy framework developed by Eshet-Alkai (2004). Findings reveal 	telecenter users are digitally illiterate in three skills: branching 	ability (ability to navigate through a nonlinear environment to find 	the desired information); reproduction ability (ability to analyze 	and synthesize the information retrieved); and information ability 	(ability to assess the quality of information). Additionally, there 	are technical barriers, such as Internet access speed, which influence 	user's behaviors when searching for information. Finally, the lack 	of knowledge of the English language, which is the predominant languages 	in the Internet, is a barrier that widens the digital divide. Based 	on these findings, this research suggests possible solutions to overcome 	user's problems. Â© 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
