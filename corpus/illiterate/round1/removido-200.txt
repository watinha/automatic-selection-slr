Teachers` computer anxiety: implications for professionaldevelopment
Changes in society‘s expectations mean that school teachers need to 	be able to use computers in education with minimal anxiety. Some 	350 primary and secondary school teachers completed a questionnaire 	that identified sources of computer anxiety and provided teachers 	with the opportunity to suggest solutions. The teachers were very 	supportive of the use of computers in education, but reported moderately 	low levels of computer competence. A number of suggestions for the 	reduction of computer anxiety are made, based on teachers‘ first-hand 	accounts, and an analysis of trends in the quantitative data. The 	implications of these suggestions for teachers‘ professional development 	are explored
