Rural Telephony: A Socio-Economic Case Study
Information and communication technology (ICT) has the potential to
bring in development to rural areas in the third world. Any deployment
of technology however should be backed by a positive economic activity
to be sustainable. This paper reports on experience with the economics,
as well as the social aspects of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) as a service.
In Jan 2003, we established a WiFi link from a site with wired Internet
connection to a remote village site. On learning the demand for a
telephone facility at the village, we setup a VoIP service. The setup
has been running with reasonable success since then. We have collected
a wide variety of statistics on the usage of the service. Although
we used the relatively low-cost WiFi technology, the expenses have
been high. The capital expense is dominated by antenna tower (40m:
U.S.$6,600). The WiFi equipment and the solar power system added
significantly to the cost too (about U.S. $3,100). The revenue generated
from the phone calls has averaged at about $52/month. Hence this
service alone may not be sufficient, and other targeted services
are necessary to sustain ICT in rural villages. However, on the positive
side we think that telephony facility can attract potential ICT users
to the setup since people can relate to the service immediately (unlike
say, Web browsing)
