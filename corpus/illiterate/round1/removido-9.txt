Signal to noise ratio of information in documentation
The signal to noise ratio is a common concept in radio communications
and electronic communication in general. For a radio, the static
is the noise. Too much static and the storm report gets drowned out,
or at least you must listen closely to understand the announcer.
Unfortunately, information designers do not posses a clear cut set
of techniques available to electrical engineers. For information
systems, taking the raw data in a system and deciding what is signal
and what is noise proves to be extremely difficult. This paper will
examine how the concept of signal to noise ratio can be applied to
documentation. It will consider how the need to address different
tasks and audience forces compromises on the writer to meet those
different needs, when each audience has different definitions of
which information constitutes signal and which constitutes noise.
