Speech enabled e-learning for adult literacy tutoring
It is estimated in a recent OECD International Adult Literacy Survey 	that up to 500,000 Irish adults are functionally illiterate, that 	is many people have difficulty in reading and understanding everyday 	documents. We address this problem by allowing users to interact 	with speech enabled e-learning literacy content using multimodal 	interfaces. We present two experimental prototypes that explore technical 	solutions and identify an application architecture suitable for literacy 	e-learning. The implementation of an evolutionary prototype that 	uses client side technology is described and feedback from this phase 	of the project is reported.
