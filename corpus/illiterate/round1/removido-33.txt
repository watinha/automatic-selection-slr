The Challenges of Technology Research for Developing Regions
The authors' projects in several developing regions encountered many
technical, cultural, and environmental challenges that are outside
the scope of typical computer science research. By sharing some of
their experiences, they hope to increase understanding of these issues.
They also hope to help others, especially researchers from outside
these regions, avoid their mistakes by suggesting steps that might
at least mitigate the problems.This article is part of a special
issue on Emerging Economies.
