Proposing a hybrid tag-camera-based identification and navigation
aid for the visually impaired
In this paper a barcode-based system to help the visually impaired
identity objects in the environment and navigate through unknown
territories is introduced. The system is based on the idea of tagging
the different objects with 2D barcodes. With the aid of a portable
camera and a computing device, the system can recognize and relay
the barcode content to the user. We present the advantages of the
proposed system compared to those of existing technologies. The different
steps for recognizing and extracting the barcodes are described and
applied to a sample image.
