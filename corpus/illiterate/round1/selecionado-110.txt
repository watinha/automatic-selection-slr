Development of a Smiling Touchscreen Multimedia Program for HRQoL 	Assessment in Subjects with Varying Levels of Literacy
Objective: As low literacy affects the assessment of health-related 	quality of life (HRQoL) in several ways (e.g., subject eligibility 	and cost of administration), better approaches to HRQoL assessment 	in subjects with varying literacy levels are needed.   	Methods: We developed a multimedia touchscreen program (the Smiling 	Touchscreen, ST) to administer HRQoL instruments to subjects with 	varying levels of Chinese language and computer literacy, using an 	iterative process where patients' input on design, clarity of instructions, 	and user-friendliness were repeatedly gathered and incorporated in 	development. The ST thus has several user-friendly features for low-literacy 	subjects (e.g., presentation of individual items using visual and 	auditory stimuli, voice-text synchronization, and visual analog scale 	with a touch and drag function), which we evaluated using qualitative 	and quantitative methods.   	Results: The ST was well accepted by subjects (n = 66, 76% female, 	median [interquartile] age: 49.0 [40.0, 56.0]) with high (n = 43) 	or low (n = 23) literacy, 98% of whom found it easy or very easy 	to use, and 85% found the voice-text synchronization feature useful. 	In low-literacy subjects without computer experience (30%), none 	reported any difficulties using the ST. The median (interquartile) 	time spent to complete the ST (four Instruction and Practice screens, 	24 questions, one visual analog scale) for high- and low-literacy 	groups was 13.9 (9.6, 23.9) and 23.2 (15.8, 26.5) minutes, respectively. 	Among subjects expressing a preference (n = 47), 21 (47%) favored 	the ST over interviewer- or self-administration.   	Conclusion: The ST is well accepted by subjects with varying literacy 	levels, including those without computer experience. It is thus a 	promising new approach for HRQoL assessment among subjects with varying 	literacy levels.
