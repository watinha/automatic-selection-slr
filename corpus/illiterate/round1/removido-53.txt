Interactive evolutionary design of anthropomorphic symbols
Although the computer science literature contains numerous examples
that describe various interactive evolutionary computational (IEC)
algorithms, few studies have focused on how use such algorithms to
elicit design information from a population of human users. The purpose
of this study was to address this gap in the literature by constructing
and testing an IEC algorithm for anthropomorphic symbol design. A
design group of 25 subjects used the algorithm to create 100 anthropomorphic
symbols represented the emotions of anger, joy, fear, and sadness.
The 100 symbols underwent comprehensions testing using a separate
group of 30 subjects. Factor analysis of the nine limb angles comprising
each symbol revealed that specific combinations of limb angles differed
significantly between symbols based on the emotional referent the
IEC algorithm users meant to convey. Comprehension testing results
revealed that recognition accuracy for the joy symbols was highest
while recognition accuracy for the anger symbols was lowest. The
findings of the current study suggest the IEC algorithms can be used
to identify important symbol design characteristics and generate
symbols whose message is readily comprehended by end user populations.
