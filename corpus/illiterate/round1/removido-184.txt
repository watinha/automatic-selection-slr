Towards a knowledge society in India\&\#58; issues for management
The paper points out that in the evolutionary process of human society,
different groups of people have been left at different levels. Therefore,
within countries, it is necessary to identify these different levels
and tailor modern knowledge/skill bases to enable their smooth transition,
instead of attempting a uniform solution. The paper discusses the
four broad levels of knowledge bases in India and how they are placed
in the Indian economy. The paper then describes how the different
levels can be lifted to better levels of productivity and wealth
creation by illustrating the types of requirements of technologies/knowledge/skills.
