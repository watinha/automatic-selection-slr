The wired city: Problem boundaries with municipal government, health
care delivery, education, state services and the informed public
This paper considers some of the sociological problems and benefits
which must be anticipated by any community which is planning a major
TV cable system with a large, on-line computer system at the cable
head, providing a large-scale data retrieval and store-and-forward
system. We will confine the discussion to the impact of (and on)
the provision of data services. The University of Illinois experiment
has already shown the basic technical feasibility of such a system
for 4000 active users.1
