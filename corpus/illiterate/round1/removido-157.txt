Blogging as social activity, or, would you let 900 million people
read your diary?
"Blogging" is a Web-based form of communication that is rapidly becoming
mainstream. In this paper, we report the results of an ethnographic
study of blogging, focusing on blogs written by individuals or small
groups, with limited audiences. We discuss motivations for blogging,
the quality of social interactivity that characterized the blogs
we studied, and relationships to the blogger's audience. We consider
the way bloggers related to the known audience of their personal
social networks as well as the wider "blogosphere" of unknown readers.
We then make design recommendations for blogging software based on
these findings.
