"Brands that Touch" and anthropology of consumption: towards an understanding
of how to design pleasurable products
This article focuses on "Brands that touch", or people's relationship
with brands that incorporate meaningful experiences and evoke positive
feelings. It views brands as synonymous with their products. It views,
also, the act of choosing and using a product as a process of symbolic
exchange and intends to bridge the fields of "Design & Emotion" and
Anthropology of Consumption. Therefore, it presents some reflections
based on personal stories about "brands that touch" gathered from
interviews and conversations with people from different walks of
life and on classic writings on theory of Anthropology of Consumption
and some of the pioneering authors in the field such as Mary Douglas,
LÃ©vi-Strauss, among others. This article's central idea is that if
we are to design pleasurable products, we must listen to users and
understand the essence and content of a brand that touches them.
