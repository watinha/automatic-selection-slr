An adaptive information retrieval system based on associative networks
In this paper we present a multilingual information retrieval system
that provides access to Tourism information by exploiting the intuitiveness
of natural language. In particular, we describe the knowledge representation
model underlying the information retrieval system. This knowledge
representation approach is based on associative networks and allows
the definition of semantic relationships between domain-intrinsic
information items. The network structure is used to define weighted
associations between information items and augments the system with
a fuzzy search strategy. This particular search strategy is performed
by a constrained spreading activation algorithm that implements information
retrieval on associative networks. Strictly speaking, we take the
relatedness of terms into account and show, how this fuzzy search
strategy yields beneficial results and, moreover, determines highly
associated matches to users' queries. Thus, the combination of the
associative network and the constrained spreading activation approach
constitutes a search algorithm that evaluates the relatedness of
terms and, therefore, provides a means for implicit query expansion.
