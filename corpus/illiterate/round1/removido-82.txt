The challenges of utilizing intelligent human-computer interface
technology in South Africa and other African developing countries
Labor mismatch problems frequently occur in developing countries,
like South Africa, that acquire advanced technology from developed
countries. Some of these problems also occur globally. Many are,
however, a result of the unique socio-cultural background of the
labor force. Special attention must be paid to human factors in the
local context to fully exploit the potential of advanced technology.
In many cases intelligent interfaces appear to present the most viable
solution. However, it is not a panacea. In certain instances a technological
solution is not feasible and training may be the only alternative.
Three key challenges in ensuring the effective exploitation of intelligent
interface technology in South Africa and other African developing
countries are described. The complexity, and consequently the risk,
in the development of intelligent interface technology can be controlled
in several ways, which are discussed
