From subject of change to agent of change: women and IT in Brazil
Brazil has one of South America's largest information technology (IT)
communities. One hundred million people voted electronically for
President and congress in 2004, and 97 percent of all income tax
declarations are submitted via the Internet. Over 20,000 students
graduate every year in computer science alone, and two of the federal
government's four industrial priorities are related to IT --- software
and semiconductors. Though women represent 60 percent of the country's
college graduates, less than 5 percent choose Computer Science as
a major. Programs to foster gender equality have little intersection
with the national digital inclusion program. This paper points out
actions that may be considered to allow Brazilian women to become
full citizens of the information society. These actions concern formal
and informal means of education, and on visibility and advocacy.
