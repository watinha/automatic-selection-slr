Critical success factors of enterprise resource planning systems 	implementation success in China
ERP implementation issues have been given much attention since two 	decades ago due to its low implementation success. Nearly 90 percent 	of ERP implementations are late or over budget (Martin, 1998) and 	the success rate with ERP implementation is about 33%. In China, 	the success rate of implementing ERP systems is extremely low at 	10% (Zhu and Ma, 1999) which is much lower than that in West countries. 	This study attempts to study critical success factors affecting enterprise 	resource planning (ERP) systems implementation success in China with 	focus on both generic and unique factors. User satisfaction and White's 	ABCD classification method are used to judge whether an ERP system 	implementation is a success or a failure. Survey methodology and 	structural equation modeling technique of PLS-graph are used to collect 	and analyze data. Discussions on the results of data analysis are 	made.
