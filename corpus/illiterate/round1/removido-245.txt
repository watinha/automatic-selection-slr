Conversational interfaces: advances and challenges
The past decade has witnessed the emergence of a new breed of human-computer
interfaces that combines several human language technologies to enable
humans to converse with computers using spoken dialogue for information
access, creation and processing. In this paper, we introduce the
nature of these conversational interfaces and describe the underlying
human language technologies on which they are based. After summarizing
some of the recent progress in this area around the world, we discuss
development issues faced by researchers creating these kinds of systems
and present some of the ongoing and unmet research challenges in
this field
