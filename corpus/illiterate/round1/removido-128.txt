A Social History of the Mobile Telephone with a View of its Future
The social history of the mobile telephone involves both the history
of technological development and an account of changing social and
political frameworks into which the new technological developments
become integrated. The technological innovations of mobile telephony
were established from the 1940s, but it was not until the 1990s that
adoption took off. It has been claimed that the mobile telephone
revolution can be explained by changes in the way communication happens
through social networks, away from old hierarchical forms. Several
unique communicative and behavioural patterns have emerged in countries
with mass use of the mobile telephone, including texting (SMS) and
the development of new social norms. Nevertheless there is still
huge global variation in use and development, and more research needs
to be conducted which responds to very local patterns of use and
reuse.
