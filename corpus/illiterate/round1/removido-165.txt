The r\^{o
Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) for people with speech 	and language disorders is an interesting and challenging application 	field for research in Natural Language Processing. Further advances 	in the development of AAC systems require robust language processing 	techniques and versatile linguistic knowledge bases. Also NLP research 	can benefit from studying the techniques used in this field and from 	the user-centred methodologies used to develop and evaluate AAC systems. 	Until recently, however, apart from some exceptions, there was little 	scientific exchange between the two research areas. This paper aims 	to make a contribution to closing this gap. We will argue that current 	interest in language use, which can be shown by the large amount 	of research on comprehensive dictionaries and on corpora processing, 	makes the results of NLP research more relevant to AAC. We will also 	show that the increasing interest of AAC researchers in NLP is having 	positive results. To situate research on communication aids, the 	first half of this paper gives an overview of the AAC research field. 	The second half is dedicated to an overview of research prototype 	systems and commercially available communication aids that specifically 	involve more advanced language processing techniques.
