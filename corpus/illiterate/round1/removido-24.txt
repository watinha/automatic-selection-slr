The Effect of Internet Usage on Interpersonal Relationships: A Case
Study
The Internet has become the fastest growing electronic technology
in world history. The rapid evolution of any technology naturally
raises questions about both its potential benefits and possible negative
consequences. One of the main issues of concern is the effect Internet
is having on interpersonal relationships. This paper investigates
the influence of the Internet on social connections among Internet
users in Iran. The results show that the Internet has not decreased
users' social contacts. Principal components analysis and the k-
means clustering technique are applied to unearth the common patterns
that exist in the dataset. Our findings show that gender is one of
the main factors in distinguishing among users based on the type
of their social contacts.
