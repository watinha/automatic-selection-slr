Towards access to information in rural India
Rural areas in India are characterized by limited land availability,
low literacy, inadequate health, sanitary and drinking water facilities.
In spite of over five decades of independence, the rural scenario
has not changed much and 75% of rural people are either manual laborers,
or artisans. In view of a variety of structural disadvantages, i.e.,
illiteracy, malnutrition, and the social complications of caste in
Indian society, there is a need to redesign the traditional public
library and its services to deal with the information needs of rural
areas.


In this connection, the National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD)
conducted a variety of studies and has come up with an action research
project aimed at establishing Public Information Centers (PIC's).
The objective of these centers will be to provide information on
rural development programmes, agricultural extension, and utilities
as well as social development information, e.g., health, education,
finance, legal. This paper discusses the issues involved as well
as the location of PIC's, databases, training, service and the sustenance
of PIC's.
