The Design and Evaluation of a Pen-Based Computer Interface for Novice 	Older Users
The population of older people is growing rapidly worldwide, so it 	is necessary for all governments to provide them more services in 	order to improve their quality of life. In a digital era, most of 	these services can be provided by information technologies. However, 	older people have a very limited computer use due to economical, 	physical, sensory and cognitive barriers. In addition, few efforts 	have been dedicated to the design of specialized computer interfaces 	for them despite the fact that they have computer interaction problems 	with the WIMP standard (windows, icons, menus, and pointers). Recently, 	some researchers have shown that older people have a better computer 	interaction with the use of direct-manipulation devices such as digital 	pens than with indirect-manipulation devices such as the mouse. This 	research goes one step further, proposing and analyzing a pen-based 	interface for older people in order to explore the usability of gesture 	paradigm for them
