Requirements analysis as innovation diffusion: a proposed requirements
analysis strategy for the development of an integrated hospital information
support system
The paper addresses one of the the challenges that must be overcome
before IT can achieve its potential in the health care field, namely
designing systems that meet user needs while reflecting a continuously
changing organisational environment. The authors proceed by establishing
a link between innovation diffusion theory and the requirements analysis
stage of systems development and discussing how the absence of such
a link might explain the frequent failure of available requirements
determination strategies. The Grounded Theory approach is examined
next as a possible requirements analysis strategy and its limitations
are identified. Preliminary results are presented for seventeen interviews
from one of the hospital sites. The paper concludes by outlining
specific plans for the empirical evaluation of the proposed approach
and posing some guiding questions for future research.
