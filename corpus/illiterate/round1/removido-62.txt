Student orientation program: a guide for higher education in Lebanon
The country of Lebanon lacks career orientation and student counseling 	at the high school and college freshman levels. In response to that 	need, we are developing in the Multimedia Center of the Faculty of 	Engineering and Architecture at the American University of Beirut 	(AUB) a multimedia software package that offers help to students 	seeking university education. We conducted a needs analysis using 	questionnaires on a stratified random sample of high school and freshman 	university students. The results were used to tailor the content 	and design of the program to student needs and their computer literacy 	level. The student orientation program (SOP) is trilingual-English, 	French and Arabic-package developed using Asymetrix Multimedia Toolbook 	to be shipped on a CD-ROM. Users will find information about all 	universities in Lebanon and the respective majors offered as well 	as brief descriptions of professional fields of study, and scholarships 	available in Lebanon. Moreover potential university students have 	the choice to solve typical real life problems related to the field 	of study under investigation. Among other options, they can view 	video clip interviews with professionals and academicians that could 	answer typical questions. Finally, SOP provides self-assessment to 	help students identify potential career paths and domains of study 	to make a better choice for their future. We intend to distribute 	this CD-ROM to high schools in Lebanon and the Middle East in an 	attempt to improve career guidance in the region
