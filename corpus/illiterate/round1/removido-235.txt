Smashing images---a review
"In the eighth century, a sect arose from within the ranks of its
highly literate clergy that so despised images that its members declared
an all-out war against statues and paintings&hellip;. At first, they
sought out only religious images to smash. Church mosaics, painted
icons, and stained-glass artistry fell to their savage assaults.
Later their targets also included painters, sculptors and craftsmen.
They even murdered those whose crime it was to love art. Monks who
resisted were blinded and had their tongues torn out. The iconoclasts
beheaded the Patriach of the Eastern Chruch in 767 for refusing to
support their cause."The iconoclast movement never spread to illiterate
Western Europe; its madness consumed only the segment of Christendom
that boasted the highest literacy rate. Artists fled for their lives
from Byzantium, heading for the western court of Charlemagne whose
largely illiterate courtiers welcomed them with open arms" (pp. 275-276)
