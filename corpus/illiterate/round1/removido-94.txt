How do varied populations interact with embodied conversational agents? 	Findings from inner-city adolescents and prisoners
Two studies were conducted to identify individual characteristics 	that predict behavioral responses to violence prevention interventions. 	These studies used embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to create 	hypothetical social situations (called virtual vignettes) to assess 	interpersonal competency skills. One study was of male inner-city 	African-American adolescents, and the second was of male prisoners 	in a state correctional system. In pre- and post-intervention sessions, 	participants interacted with an ECA that tried to entice them into 	making risky decisions. The virtual vignette sessions tested participants' 	negotiation and conflict resolution skills. Results showed differing 	tendencies for participants to be engaged by the virtual vignettes. 	The vignettes were sufficiently realistic to elicit differences in 	behavior among the adolescents, but generally not for the prisoners. 	Prior acceptance, accessibility, and usability data suggest that 	most users readily accept ECAs as valid conversational partners. 	The evidence presented here suggests that the technology - or the 	setting in which the technology is used - is not by itself sufficient 	to actively engage users. The usefulness of virtual vignettes to 	adequately predict future behavior may be at least partially influenced 	by participant characteristics.
