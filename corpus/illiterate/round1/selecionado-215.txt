Information needs and preferences of low and high literacy consumers 	for decisions about colorectal cancer screening: utilizing a linguistic 	model
Context The use of written decision aids (DAs) in clinical practice 	has proliferated. However, few DAs have been developed for low literacy 	users, despite this group having low knowledge about healthcare and 	lacking involvement in health decisions.   	Objective To explore the information needs and understanding of adults 	with varying literacy in relation to colorectal cancer screening, 	and to consider their responses to two versions of a decision aid.   	Participants Thirty-three men and women aged 45â€“74 years were recruited 	from Adult Basic Education classes (n = 17) and University Continuing 	Education programs (n = 16).   	Methods We used qualitative methods (in-depth, semi-structured interviews) 	to compare and contrast the views of adults with lower and higher 	literacy levels, to gain a better understanding of how people with 	lower literacy value and interpret specific DA content and components; 	and determine whether needs and preferences are specific to lower 	literacy groups or generic across the broad literacy spectrum.   	Results Regardless of literacy perspective, participants' interpretations 	of the DA were shaped by their prior knowledge and expectations, 	as well as their values and preferences. This influenced perceptions 	of the DAs role in supporting informed decision making. A linguistic 	theoretical model was applied to interpret the findings. This facilitated 	considerations beyond the traditional focus on the readability of 	materials.   	Conclusion Decision aids developers may find it useful to apply alternative 	approaches (linguistic) when creating DAs for consumers of varying 	literacy.
