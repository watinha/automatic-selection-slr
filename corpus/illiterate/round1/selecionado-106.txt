StoryBank: an indian village community digital library
This paper considers information access styles for a community digital 	library in an Indian village. We present our impressions of the community 	gathered during a field-study and show how these have influenced 	the interaction design. The prototype aims to overcome low-textual 	literacy and lack of computing experience by combining touch-based 	interaction, engaging visual presentations and drawing on villagers' 	familiarity with radio listening.
