GE's MEAD user interface-a flexible menu- and forms-driven interface
for engineering applications
The user interface (UI) of the MEAD computer-aided control engineering
(CACE) program is presented. After a brief presentation of the MEAD
computer program, the unifying philosophy behind the MEAD UI is discussed.
Main features of this UI include a point-and-click-style interaction,
a unifying grouping of similar functionality, and a graphical interface
to its CACE database management system. A typical modeling, analysis,
and design scenario is given to illustrate the interface. The use
of a user interface management system (UIMS) in the design and implementation
of the MEAD UI is discussed. The MEAD user interface is implemented
using an experimental UIMS developed at GE which supports both a
Tektronix terminal and X-window-based window systems. Some implementational
features of the MEAD user interface are that it is implemented using
an object-oriented database system; that it uses a state tree to
specify the dialog control; and that it is created entirely by means
of a graphical editor, thereby avoiding conventional programming.
The architecture of the UIMS is described and the implications of
creating a user interface with this UIMS are discussed
