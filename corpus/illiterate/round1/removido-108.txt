Adding User-Level SPACe: Security, Privacy, and Context to Intelligent
Multimedia Information Architectures
We provide a unified architecture, called SPACe, for Secure, Privacy-Aware,
and Contextual multimedia systems in organizations. Many key and
important architectural components already exist which contribute
to a unified platform, including the classic data mining, security,
and privacy-preserving components in conventional intelligent systems.
After presenting an overview of our unified architecture, we focus
on the state-of-the-art architectural components for user interaction
in future systems - particularly multimedia voice interaction with
intelligent systems. This paper shows how user-level conversational
data mining (CDM) methods, coupled with biometric security, and enhanced
with privacy- awareness, may be used with any Web information system
architecture. Finally, we provide an example of our unified architecture
through integrating a knowledge architecture for an e-finance application
in the financial services domain. The resulting architectures benefit
from added security, privacy-awareness, and contextual filtering
at the user-level.
