HCI for people with cognitive disabilities
The self-advocacy movement (Dybwad & Bersani, 1996) grew out of resistance
to oppressive practices of institutionalization (and worse) for people
with cognitive disabilities. Moving beyond the worst abuses, people
with cognitive disabilities seek as full participation in society
as possible.
