The case for technology in developing regions
Alongside good governance, technology is considered among the greatest
enablers for improved quality of life. However, the majority of its
benefits have been concentrated in industrialized nations and therefore
limited to a fraction of the world's population. We believe that
technology has a large role to play in developing regions, that "First
World" technology to date has been a poor fit in these areas, and
that there is thus a need for technology research for developing
regions. Despite the relative infancy of technology studies in developing
regions, anecdotal evidence suggests that access to technology has
a beneficial economic impact. Cellular telephony is probably the
most visible application, but there are many others, some of which
we cover in this article. The World Bank's infoDev site catalogs
hundreds of information and communications technologies (ICT) projects,
albeit not all successful. Most of these projects use existing off-the-shelf
technology designed for the industrialized world. Although it is
clear that there are large differences in assumptions related to
cost, power, and usage, there has been little work on how technology
needs in developing regions differ from those of industrialized nations.
We argue that Western market forces continue to meet the needs of
developing regions accidentally at best.
