A peer-to-peer architecture for the collaborative construction of 	scientific theories by virtual communities
Needs for bidirectional nonvertical access to information and learning 	are evident and urgent. We cannot impose pervasive, huge investments 	to developing country's users forcing them to wait. Peer-to-peer 	architectures integrated with interoperable XML documents are currently 	the most suited means for direct, bidirectional access to information 	within virtual communities. We show how such an architecture may 	improve the effectiveness of a previously developed tool for literacy 	in Brazil, at the same time as it enables highly qualified scientists 	in the West to cooperate on the Web today, on the grid tomorrow.
