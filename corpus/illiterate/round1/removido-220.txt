Internet and electronic information management
The number and types of information sources accessible through the
Internet are ever increasing. Billions of documents including text,
pictures, sound, and video are readily available for both scholarly
and every-day uses. Even libraries and information centers with sizable
budgets are having difficulties in coping with this increase. More
developed tools and methods are needed to find, filter, organize
and summarize electronic information sources. This paper is an overview
of a wide variety of electronic information management issues ranging
from infrastructure to the integration of information technology
and content, from personalization of information services to “disintermediation”.
It discusses the issues of description, organization, collection
management, preservation and archiving of electronic information.
