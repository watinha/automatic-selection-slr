From usability tasks to usable user interfaces
In this paper we describe how the identification of usability tasks 	in the task model as an early consideration of usability in the process 	can directly influence the design of usable User Interfaces (UI). 	We intend to make system analysts and UI designers work and communicate 	better by sharing artifacts, thus providing a process that aims at 	the integration of professionals working with a productive process 	in order to develop UIs with usability.
