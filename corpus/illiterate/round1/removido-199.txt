Establishing relationships for designing rural information systems
Designing for the developing world presents unique challenges. Establishing
rapport with local partners is important to overcome contextual unfamiliarity
and ensure the relevance of proposed solutions. In this paper, we
discuss our experiences designing a CAM-based mobile data capture
system for Asobagri, a rural coffee cooperative in Barillas, Guatemala.
CAM is a camera-based mobile application framework designed based
on fieldwork with rural microfinance groups in India. Our local partners
in India are now using the CAM framework in a real application. We
list some practices that have helped us establish and sustain both
these design relationships.
