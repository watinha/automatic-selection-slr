Theory and practice of e-governance in India: a gender perspective
In India women's ability to participate in the country's rapid progress
towards e-governance is impeded by the low status ascribed to women
and girls in Indian society. This is reflected in the gender disparity
in many sectors with women in a disadvantaged position in India.
Extreme poverty and poor IT infrastructure in rural areas, where
the majority of Indian women reside, further restrict women's access
to education and information technology. Such an iniquitous position
of women has contributed enormously to the slow pace of development
in India. The issue of gender equity is not a supplement to development
and e-governance but central to both. While the e-governance initiatives
are theoretically comprehensive and aimed at inclusion of every citizen,
the last digital node, unless the gender perspective is taken into
account, a huge gap is bound to remain between the theory and practice
of e-governance in India with attendant effects on development. Despite
the many e-governance initiatives and massive investments in information
communication technologies (ICTs) in India, a gender gap might exclude
or restrict women to be equal partners and beneficiaries of the e-
governance initiatives.
