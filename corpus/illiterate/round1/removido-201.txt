Assessing limiting factors to the acceptance of antiretroviral therapy 	in a large cohort of injecting drug users
Objective   	A comprehensive questionnaire was designed to assess the knowledge 	and understanding of injecting drug users (IDUs) regarding their 	HIV disease, and to determine any factors that may increase the acceptance 	of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by this group.   	Results   	Twenty percent of the total IDU cohort attending the GUIDE (GenitoUrinary 	Medicine and Infectious Diseases) clinic participated in the study. 	Fifty-two percent had been homeless in the past 5 years and 84% are 	unemployed. Seventy-two percent of patients did not complete second 	level education and 10% were illiterate. Fifty-one percent had siblings 	or parents with a history of injection drug misuse, and 25% had at 	least one sibling also HIV positive. Forty-seven percent started 	using drugs before the age of 13 years, and the most common initial 	drug was heroin (44%). Ninety-five percent had attended for methadone 	maintenance therapy (MMT), with 39% currently attending for daily 	therapy. The majority of patients were unable to simply explain or 	interpret CD4 cell counts (54%) and 'viral loads' (65%). Fifty-seven 	percent of patients were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy 	(HAART). There was a statistically significant association between 	patients receiving HAART and both attendance at a primary care physician 	for methadone maintenance therapy (P = 0.005), and weekly take-outs 	of methadone (P = 0.005). There was also an association between adherence 	to HAART and attendance at a methadone maintenance clinic (P = 0.04).   	Conclusions   	This study highlights the chaotic lifestyle and complex social background 	of the IDU. Such factors were not, however, associated with acceptance 	of HAART. The primary factor associated with both the acceptance 	of and adherence to HAART was regular and stable attendance for methadone 	therapy.
