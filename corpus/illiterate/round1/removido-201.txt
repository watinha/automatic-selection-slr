Learning e-learning -- a comprehensive investigation of course developers'
and language teacher trainees' views regarding the usefulness and
effectiveness of a multimedia self-tuition course
The paper presents the results of a comparative investigation of course
developers’ and teacher trainees’ views regarding the usefulness
and effectiveness of a multimedia self-tuition course designed to
introduce foreign language teacher trainees to tools and methods
for organising computer-assisted language learning. The paper first
provides a brief description of the home-study course itself. It
describes the course’s main components, its content as well as the
learning and evaluation tasks the course provides in support of the
learning process. Next, the paper reports on the way in which the
evaluation project investigating teacher trainees’ and course developers’
views regarding the effectiveness of the course was set up. The project’s
design is presented, and the way in which various procedures of data
collection (written evaluations and individual interviews) were triangulated
is commented on. In the third section we present the investigation’s
main findings. The section focuses on points of agreement and disagreement
between developers’ and trainees’ views regarding the usefulness
and effectiveness of the course. Finally, we describe the changes
brought about by the evaluation project, and reflect on the necessity
to take account of future users’ views and requirements in the design
and development process if the training of foreign language teachers
is to benefit from web-based delivery.
