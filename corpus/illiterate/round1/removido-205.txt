Collage CAPTCHA
Nowadays, many daily human activities such as education, commerce,
talks, etc. are carried out through the Internet. In cases such as
the registering in websites, some hackers write programs to make
automatic false enrolments which waste the resources of the website
while this may even stop the entire website from working. Therefore,
it is necessary to tell apart human users from computer programs
which is known as CAPTCHA (completely automated p[ublic turing test
to tell computers and human apart). CAPTCHA methods are mainly based
on the weak points of OCR (optical character recognition) systems
while using them are undesirable to human users. In this paper a
method has been presented for telling the human users and computer
softwares apart on the basis of choice of an object shown on the
screen. In this method some pictures are chosen randomly and after
effecting some changes such as rotating, all of them are shown on
the screen. Then we ask the user to choose a specific object. If
the user chooses the right object we can guess that the user has
been a human being not computer software. The main advantage of this
method is its simplicity because the user does not have to type anything.
This method has been implemented by the Java programming language.
