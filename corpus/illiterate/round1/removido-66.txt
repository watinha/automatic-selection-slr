Computer graphics, interactive technologies and collaborative learning
synergy supporting individuals' skills development
In this paper, we describe work carried out using the synergy of interactive
technologies, computer graphics and collaborative learning to improve
educators and students' knowledge of basic education by supporting
interdisciplinary work.Through direct manipulating accessible Web
standard languages such as Hyper Text Markup Language - HTML and
Virtual Reality Modeling Language - VRML and their templates, we
used interactive graphics techniques and tools, including learning
theories and methodologies such as experiential learning as support
for enhancing children's interest on studying and authoring content
related to subjects such as Mathematics, Geography, Geometry, Languages
and Arts.As a consequence of these human and technical interactions,
including knowledge acquisition, we achieved an increase in individuals'
traditional and digital literacy skills, social inclusion, and community
collaborative work engagement inside and outside school environment.
Further we found an improvement in curriculum development.
