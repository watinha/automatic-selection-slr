Speech interfaces for equitable access to information technology
Speech recognition has often been suggested as a key to universal
information access, as the speech modality is a “natural” way to
interact, does not require literacy, and relies on existing telephony
infrastructure. However, success stories of speech interfaces in
developing regions are few and far between. The challenges of literacy,
dialectal variation, and the prohibitive expense of creating the
necessary linguistic resources are intractable using traditional
techniques. We present our findings evaluating a low-cost, scalable
speech-driven application designed and deployed in a community center
in rural Tamil Nadu, India, to disseminate agricultural information
to village farmers.
