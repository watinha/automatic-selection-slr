simplification, consolidation, higher efficiency and reliability,
etc., quality issues, protocols and drivers; challenges and regulatory

Further, highlights its potentiality for India, implications of guidelines
of Internet telephony, issues of concern, etc. Concludes that Internet
telephony cannot make compromises in voice quality, reliability,
scalability and manageability, and work seamlessly with telephone

boon for a price-sensitive market like India and rural telephony
will receive an impetus. The Government of India may further deregulate
the market and allow phone-to-phone telephony through the Internet
and open long distance calling within the country for ISPs to realize
''telecom for the common man'' or ''telecom for all'' a reality.
