Controlling appliances with pen and paper
Networked appliances are consumer or household devices with a network
interface which allows them to he connected to a (home) network.
Networked appliances offer major benefits compared to their conventional
equivalent. Software services can operate upon an array of these
appliances to offer value added functionality. In this case the user
interface to control the appliances will be inadequate. Commonly
networked appliances may either he controlled using the traditional
user interface, such as switches and buttons on the device, or alternatively
using a PC based interface. Traditional user interfaces often cannot
support the full functionality offered by the appliance. The PC based
interfaces tend to be too complicated for the average user and enables
the PC based interface to be suitable and available in many situations.
Therefore a user interface which supports the new functionalities
and is easy to use is required. In this paper, Anoto functionality
enabled pen and paper are suggested as a suitable interface. Pen
and paper are well known to all users and suitable paper forms make
it straightforward to fully control and program networked appliances
without a PC interface. Thus an important barrier to the acceptance
of networked appliances is broken. Furthermore, the presented approach
can be used to integrate the control of multiple appliances and services.
A major challenge to this work has been the integration of different
network protocols used in the home. The use of an OSGi gateway has
proven a great help to integrate them. This paper discusses an approach
to the integration of pen and paper with networked appliances using
an OSGi gateway. Because of the use of an OSGi gateway, the approach
is not restricted to controlling devices which use a specific single
network protocol. Rather, the approach can be used with appliances
which communicate using a wide variety of protocols.
