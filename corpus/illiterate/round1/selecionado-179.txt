Speech Recognition for Illiterate Access to Information and Technology
In rural Tamil Nadu and other predominantly illiterate communities
throughout the world, computers and technology are currently inaccessible
without the help of a literate mediator. Speech recognition has often
been suggested as a key to universal access, but success stories
of speech-driven interfaces for illiterate end users are few and
far between. The challenges of dialectal variation, multilingualism,
cultural barriers, choice of appropriate content, and, most importantly,
the prohibitive expense of creating the necessary linguistic resources
for effective speech recognition are intractable using traditional
techniques. This paper presents an inexpensive approach for gathering
the linguistic resources needed to power a simple spoken dialog system.
In our approach, data collection is integrated into dialog design:
Users of a given village are recorded during interactions, and their
speech semi-automatically integrated into the acoustic models for
that village, thus generating the linguistic resources needed for
automatic recognition of their speech. Our design is multi-modal,
scalable, and modifiable. It is the result of an international, cross-disciplinary
collaboration between researchers and NGO workers who serve the rural
poor in Tamil Nadu. Our groundwork includes user studies, stakeholder
interviews and field recordings of literate and illiterate agricultural
workers in three districts of Tamil Nadu over the summer and fall
of 2005. Automatic speech recognition experiments simulating the
spoken dialog systems' performance during initialization and gradual
integration of acoustic data informed the holistic structure of the
design. Our research addresses the unique social and economic challenges
of the developing world by relying on modifiable and highly transparent
software and hardware, by building on locally available resources,
and by emphasizing community operation and ownership through training
and education
