Language Processing Modulated by Literacy: A Network Analysis of
Verbal Repetition in Literate and Illiterate Subjects
Previous behavioral and functional neuroimaging data indicate that
certain aspects of phonological processing may not be acquired spontaneously,
but are modulated by learning an alphabetic written language, that
is, learning to read and write. It appears that learning an alphabetic
written language modifies the auditory-verbal (spoken) language processing
competence in a nontrivial way. We have previously suggested, based
on behavioral and functional neuroimaging data, that auditory-verbal
and written language interact not only during certain language tasks,
but that learning and developing alphabetic written language capacities
significantly modulates the spoken language system. Specifically,
the acquisition of alphabetic orthographic knowledge has a modulatory
influence on sublexical phonological processing and the awareness
of sublexical phonological structure. We have suggested that developing
an orthographic representation system for an alphabetic written language,
and integrating a phoneme-grapheme correspondence with an existing
infrastructure for auditory-verbal language processing, will result
in a modified language network. Specifically, we suggest that the
parallel interactive processing characteristics of the underlying
language-processing brain network differ in literate and illiterate
subjects. Therefore, the pattern of interactions between the regions
of a suitably defined large-scale functional-anatomical network for
language processing will differ between literate and illiterate subjects
during certain language tasks. In order to investigate this hypothesis
further, we analyzed the observed covariance structure in a PET data
set from a simple auditory-verbal repetition paradigm in literate
and illiterate subjects, with a network approach based on structural
equation modeling (SEM). Based on a simple network model for language
processing, the results of the present network analysis indicate
that the network interactions during word and pseudoword repetition
in the illiterate group differ, while there were no significant differences
in the literate group. The differences between the two tasks in the
illiterate group may reflect differences in attentional modulation
of the language network, executive aspects of verbal working memory
and the articulatory organization of verbal output. There were no
significant differences between the literate and illiterate group
during word repetition. In contrast, the network interactions differed
between the literate and illiterate group during pseudoword repetition.
In addition to differences similar to those observed in the illiterate
group between word and pseudoword repetition, there were differences
related to the interactions of the phonological loop between the
groups. In particular, these differences related to the interaction
between Broca's area and the inferior parietal cortex as well as
the posterior-midinsula bridge between Wernicke's and Broca's area.
In conclusion, the results of this network analysis are consistent
with our previously presented results and support the hypothesis
that learning to read and write during childhood influences the functional
architecture of the adult human brain. In particular, the basic auditory-verbal
language network in the human brain is modified as a consequence
of acquiring orthographic language skills.
