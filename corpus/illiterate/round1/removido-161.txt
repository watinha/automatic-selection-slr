Design of an advanced platform for citizen participation committed
to ensuring freedom of speech
The expansion of new platforms of digital democracy does not necessarily
entail an increase in citizen participation. The VOTESCRIPT group
has made a sociological analysis to determine the causes of this
apparent failure, reaching the conclusion that users are demanding
capabilities that are not available in present systems.


This paper presents a proposal for an advanced system of debate in
an environment of digital democracy which overcomes the limitations
of existing systems. We have been especially careful in applying
security procedures in telematic systems, for they are to offer citizens
the guarantees that society demands. New functional tools have been
included to ensure user authentication and to permit anonymous participation
where the system is unable to disclose or even to know the identity
of system users. The platform prevents participation by non-entitled
persons who do not belong to the authorized group from giving their
opinion. Furthermore, this proposal allows for verifying the proper
function of the system, free of tampering or fraud intended to alter
the conclusions or outcomes of participation. All these tools guarantee
important aspects of both a social and technical nature, most importantly:
freedom of expression, equality and auditability.
