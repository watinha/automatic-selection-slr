Computers, programming and people
Now part of consumer society and marketed globally, computers are 	designed to be sold rather than used. Software marketers, e-businesses, 	and their technicians consider having an understanding of how the 	underlying machinery works to be utterly irrelevant.

The profession should strive to make it easy for people to exploit 	the computer on their own terms in their own culture. The symbolic 	programming system should be completely straightforward, but adaptable 	to different writing systems. Any complexity should be subsumed by 	the operating system or concealable within the macro-coding system
