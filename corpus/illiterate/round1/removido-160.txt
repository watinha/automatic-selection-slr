The social relations of e-government diffusion in developing countries: 	the case of Rwanda
Rwanda has undergone a rapid turnaround from one of the most technologically 	deficient countries only a decade ago to a country where legislative 	business is conducted online and wireless access to the Internet 	is available anywhere in the country. This is puzzling when viewed 	against the limited progress made in other comparable developing 	countries, especially those located in the same region, sub-Saharan 	Africa, where the structural and institutional constraints to e-government 	diffusion are similar. Based on an exploratory case study of the 	country's e-government system that draws on group and social theories, 	I argue that the convergence of four factors associated with the 	policy environment, political leadership, emigrants and refugee returnees, 	and epistemic communities account for Rwanda's achievements. The 	primacy of interest group politics in the unfolding story of e-government 	diffusion in developing countries is underscored and potential areas 	for further research highlighted.
