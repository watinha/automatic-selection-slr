The user experience: designs and adaptations
Specifications for accessibility of Web pages do not necessarily guarantee 	a usable or satisfying Web experience for persons with disabilities. 	The needs of many of these individuals fall outside guidelines for 	accessible content. Many of these users, for example, wish that they 	simply could "enlarge" what is on a Web page. They also express the 	wish that pages would be "less confusing". To meet these needs, Web 	browsers and various software applications provide for a variety 	of ways in which page presentations can be altered. The effects of 	these alterations often have unexpected consequences. Some designs 	accommodate these alterations better than others. This paper discusses 	one such application that allows users to control features of Web 	page presentation and explores design features that facilitate such 	control.
