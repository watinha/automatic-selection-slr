Supporting reflective web searching in elementary schools
In this contribution, two design experiments are presented in which
reflective web searching is implemented in six elementary classrooms.
Reflective web searching is viewed to comprise three steps: (1) develop
ownership over search questions, (2) interpret and personalize web
content, and (3) adapt web content into personally meaningful answers.
A portal and a worksheet supported reflective web searching. A wide
range of qualitative data, including observations, interviews and
group products, was collected to gain insight in the emerging practices.
The findings show that the portal and worksheet successfully contributed
to the development of ownership, and the interpretation and personalization
of retrieved information. Enabling children to search the web collaboratively
further enhanced interpretation and personalization. The prototypes
of both portal and worksheet were improved across the design experiments,
and their success rates increased. Despite the improvements, the
process of adaptation was not sufficiently supported by the portal
and worksheet.
