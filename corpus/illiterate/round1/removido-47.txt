The book as user interface: lowering the entry cost to email for 	elders
Substantial stumbling blocks confront computer-illiterate elders. 	We introduce a novel user interface technology to lower these start 	up costs: the book as user interface, or BUI. Book pages contain 	both step-by-step instructions and tangible controls, turning a complex 	interaction into a walk-up-and-use scenario. The system expands support 	past the technical artifact to a go-to relationship. ElderMail users 	designate an internet-savvy trusted friend or relative to help with 	complex tasks. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary evaluation 	of a BUI-based email system, and report our findings. While research 	has augmented paper artifacts to provide alternate access into the 	digital world, we find that elders use the BUI as a way to circumvent 	the digital world.
