Metacognitive theories of visual programming: what do we think we 	are doing?
The research involved a qualitative and quantitative study of statements 	made by computer scientists about the ways in which they think that 	visual programming assists the thought processes of the programmer. 	This type of metacognitive knowledge has been shown in psychological 	experiments to have significant effects on performance in cognitive 	tasks. It is particularly important in the design of programming 	environments, where HCI factors of the environment constrain the 	programmer's design behaviour according to the beliefs of the environment 	designer. The metacognitive knowledge expressed in the visual programming 	literature is categorised in the paper into a range of micro-theories, 	the frequency of statements found in each category are compared, 	and the theoretical assumptions are evaluated in terms of relevant 	research in cognitive psychology
