Integrating computing science undergraduate education
With over 50 years of computer science in existence, a great effort
has been spent on designing the best curricular for educating computer
scientists, educating computing professionals, as well as educating
users of computers. In spite of this, there has not been in evidence
an approach to creating a flexible university environment, which
supports a flow between those three basic and different types of
computing education. This paper presents a model of integrated computing
education which allows for: obtaining different level of computing
knowledge and proficiency, fast and flexible upgradability of computing
skills, adding computing knowledge and skills to knowledge already
possessed in another discipline. Finally the model recognizes the
value of Prior Learning Professional Experience (PLPE) as a factor
in computing education
