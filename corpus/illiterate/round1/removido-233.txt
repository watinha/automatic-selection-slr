3D interactive, on-site visualization of ancient Olympia
This paper describes the work performed for the ARCHEOGUIDE (Augmented 	Reality-based Cultural Heritage On-site GUIDE) project. ARCHEOGUIDE 	is funded by the EU IST framework (IST-1999-11306), and pursued by 	a consortium of European organizations. It delivers an interactive, 	personalized, augmented reality (AR) guide for the visualization 	of ruined archaeological sites. It is based on mobile real-time computing, 	networking, and 3D visualization. Its users are presented with monument 	reconstructions, navigation aid and historical information in a user-friendly 	way through the use of multi-modal interaction techniques. The key 	features of the system are a novel hybrid position and orientation 	tracking technique used in determining the user's viewpoint, navigation 	aid, outdoor operation, and real-time 3D visualization of monuments, 	artifacts, and life. This paper presents examples of the system's 	use at the archaeological site of ancient Olympia in Greece.
