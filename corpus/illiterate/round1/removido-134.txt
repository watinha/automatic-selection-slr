Money demand function versus monetary integration: Revisiting panel
cointegration among GCC countries
This paper applies the newly developed panel cointegrated technique
[R. Larsson, J. Lyhagen, M. Lothgren, Likelihood-based cointegration
tests in heterogeneous panels, Econom. J. 4 (1) (2001) 109-142] that
allows for multiple cointegrated relationships to empirically re-examine
the long-run money demand function for six selected countries of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1979-2000. At the center of
focus is a discussion on the regional money demand phenomena with
challenges and potential benefits, because of these GCC member adoption
this monetary integration policy. It is determined that there are
at least two cointegrated relations in the four-dimensional vector
error correction model for the variables of the real money balance,
the real scale variable, the nominal interest rate, and the exchange
rate. The coefficient restriction test is also conducted, and it
substantiates that the full panel test significantly rejects the
hypothesis of the quantity theory of money for the long-run elasticity
of income equal to unity, and we are able to reject the null hypothesis
when the semi-elasticities of the nominal interest rate and exchange
rate are equal to zero. Some critical policy implications emerge
from the results.
