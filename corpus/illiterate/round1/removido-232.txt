User study on family communication in China
Family is a core element of society. The development of economics
and the transformation of cultures in mainland China bring new challenges
to family communications. To understand current practices and the
needs of family communication in mainland China, we studied 27 rural
and urban families with ethnographic methods. We summarized the main
family structures for rural and urban families and also found three
main family communication problems: emotional communication, the
education of children and elder support. These three problems exist
in both rural and urban areas, but in different forms. Two concepts,
an emotional poster in village and a learning community based on
family/village clan, were designed and presented to address the problems.
