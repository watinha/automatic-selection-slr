Instructional multimedia institutes for mathematics, science and 	technology educators
This paper describes the intensive two-week summer institutes funded 	by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as part of an Advanced Technological 	Education project that provides instruction for 40 secondary teachers 	and college faculty in mathematics, science, and technology. Each 	participant will attend two consecutive summer institutes, and create 	a website and a Multimedia Learning Activity for classroom use. Participants 	received stipends and individual copies of software for screen capture, 	web development, animation, and digital imaging.
