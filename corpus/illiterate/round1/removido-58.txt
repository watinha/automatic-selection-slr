Organizational usability of digital libraries in the courts
Digital libraries (DLs) are the focus of professional movements in
the medical, legal, and scholarly communities. DLs are being used
increasingly nationwide in the legal profession for research; computer-integrated
court reporting; and for trial presentations of multimedia documents
and evidence photos. We present results of a study which contributes
to DL research by examining some new DL design concepts within the
legal domain. Two key forms of DL usability-interface and organizational-are
discussed. While the human-computer-interaction (HCI) research community
has made progress in improving interface usability, organizational
usability is less well understood. We introduce the concept of organizational
usability which refers to the mix between a computer system's design
and an organization's characteristics such that the system can be
effectively integrated into the work practices of members of the
organization and is socially accepted by them. We explore the technical
and sociotechnical dimensions of organizational usability by applying
them to DLs used in the California Superior Courts
