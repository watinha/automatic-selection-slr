An overview of pen computing
Pen computing broadly refers to an interdisciplinary matter and attracts
many researchers recent years. In this paper we review four aspects
of pen computing, say, pen-computing devices, pen interfaces, online
handwriting recognition systems and pen computer applications. On
the one hand we present a contour of pen computing, on the other
hand, by virtual of reviewing the state of the art of pen computing,
we also find many dissatisfaction in pen computing and hence consider
that to further promote the development of pen computing, firstly
researchers need to improve the hardware performance of pen computers
and secondly to develop pen-base operating systems and more friendly
pen interfaces and lastly to propose more better recognition algorithms.
