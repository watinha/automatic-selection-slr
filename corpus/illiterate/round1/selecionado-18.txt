Developmental informatics at IIT Bombay
IIT Bombay's Developmental Informatics Lab is a cross disciplinary
group consisting of 6 faculty, 30 research staff and several students.
The lab is working towards increasing access to information -- through
the use of internet and communication technologies -- to communities
in the developing world especially rural and small town India. The
lab is supported by Indian Government funding sources as well as
corporate and multi-lateral agencies to solve technical problems
in local communities in sustainable ways. This paper focuses on two
mature projects of the lab -- one caters to Indian farmers while
another helps with the education of tribal populations.
