Online Collage CAPTCHA
In some websites it is necessary to tell apart human users from computer 	programs which is known as CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing 	test to tell Computers and Human Apart). CAPTCHA methods are mainly 	based on the weak points of OCR systems while using them are undesirable 	to human users. In this paper a method has been presented for telling 	the human users and computer softwares apart on the basis of choice 	of an object shown on the screen. In this method some objects are 	chosen randomly and the pictures about these topics are downloaded 	from Internet. Then after effecting some changes such as rotating, 	all of the pictures are shown on the screen. Then we ask the user 	to choose a specific object. If the user chooses the right object 	we can guess that the user has been a human being and not a computer 	software. The main advantage of this method is its simplicity because 	the user does not have to type anything.
