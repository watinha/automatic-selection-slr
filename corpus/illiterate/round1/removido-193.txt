\, {N}uu Xaa: a system to support homeless people's self-subsistence
In this paper we present Ñuu Xaa, a tin collecting bank to support
homeless people's self-subsistence in the city of Huajuapan de León.
The main goal of this system is to improve homeless people's quality
of life by providing them with the opportunity to have remunerative
self-employment. We think that the implementation of Ñuu Xaa will
bring homeless people social, economical and psychological benefits
because they will be able to earn enough money in order to satisfy
their elementary needs and the community will understand that homeless
people aren't lazy but just people in need.
