Evaluation of American Sign Language Generation by Native ASL Signers
There are many important factors in the design of evaluation studies 	for systems that generate animations of American Sign Language (ASL) 	sentences, and techniques for evaluating natural language generation 	of written texts are not easily adapted to ASL. When conducting user-based 	evaluations, several cultural and linguistic characteristics of members 	of the American Deaf community must be taken into account so as to 	ensure the accuracy of evaluations involving these users. This article 	describes an implementation and user-based evaluation (by native 	ASL signers) of a prototype ASL natural language generation system 	that produces sentences containing classifier predicates, which are 	frequent and complex spatial phenomena that previous ASL generators 	have not produced. Native signers preferred the system's output to 	Signed English animations -- scoring it higher in grammaticality, 	understandability, and naturalness of movement. They were also more 	successful at a comprehension task after viewing the system's classifier 	predicate animations.
