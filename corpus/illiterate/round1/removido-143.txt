Challenges in computerized job search for the developing world
We examine the broad challenges facing a computer-based system to
help match low-income domestic workers from an urban slum with potential
middle-class employers in Bangalore, India. Due to the near impossibility
of implementing such a system in one shot, we first implemented a
paper-based system that provides the intended functionality but without
a computer. This system proved a significant challenge in itself,
and among the lessons learned are the crucial role of human intermediaries
(necessary even in the final computer-based system), the importance
of building skills among the domestic workers, the need for a strong
value proposition for both employers and employees well above existing
systems, and the requirement of technological literacy. We then show
that these lessons are applicable to other scenarios where computing
technology is applied to developing-world challenges, by analyzing
corresponding issues in related work. \ \ Our broad conclusion is
that computer-based systems to solve developing-world problems often
require significant work above and beyond an implementation of the
technology, with trustworthy human intermediaries playing a critical
role. \
