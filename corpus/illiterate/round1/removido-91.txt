Phone-Web: Accessing WWW using a telephone set
In order to provide a ubiquitous, comprehensive and versatile service
on the WWW the development of a WWW telephone browsing system named
Phone-Web is proposed. This Phone-Web browser system would act as
an intermediary between the telephone user and Web sites, thereby
facilitating access to the WWW from any phone. The Phone-Web system
would filter Web page information and then convert it into speech
format. Users of the Phone-Web system could retrieve and hear information
stored on WWW servers by using telephone handsets. For this system
to work it requires a new hypertext language “Hyper Phone Markup
Language” (HPML) and a dedicated Phone-Web browser. By using the
proposed HPML language, Web page designers can easily specify service
information in a set of HPML pages, which would be included in the
site they are designing. The Phone-Web browser would be capable of
retrieving and then converting the HPML pages into speech patterns.
By connecting to the Phone-Web browser, telephone users can access
any information on any site using the HPML language from any telephone
anywhere in the world. However, HPML-specified pages can also be
accessed using existing browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Microsoft
Internet Explorer, etc.) This means that both telephone and computer
users can now access the same set of Web pages to retrieve the same
information. Therefore, instead of maintaining the existing two systems
(access via the telephone or computer) service providers can now
maintain one system, which would provide a versatile, and comprehensive
service for users at all levels of Web-literacy.
