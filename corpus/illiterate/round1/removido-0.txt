Sociotechnical research and knowledge communication in community\&\#45;centred
systems design\&\#58; a technological frames perspective
An application of the concept of technological frames is presented
as a way to understand the co-configuration of people, culture and
technology. It shows how technological frames can be used to solve
the problems that arise when the producers of a system come from
a very different cultural and technological environment from the
intended users of the system. This concept is proposed as an analysis
framework whose purpose is twofold: to be used in the evaluation
of how the context and local culture shape the utility and usability
of interactive systems, both in their development and also once they
are deployed to their actual contexts of use and to understand the
dynamics of technical and interpersonal communication in communities
of practice. This is illustrated with a case study about the ongoing
research in the participative development of Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) artefacts for a wireless and web based knowledge
based system for Kenyan farming communities.
