Designing an architecture for delivering mobile information services
to the rural developing world
Implementing successful rural computing applications requires addressing
a number of significant challenges. Recent advances in mobile phone
computing capabilities make this device a likely candidate to address
the client hardware constraints. Long battery life, wireless connectivity,
solid-state memory, low price and immediate utility all make it better
suited to rural conditions than a PC. However, current mobile software
platforms are not as appropriate. Web-based mobile applications are
hard to use, do not take advantage of the mobile phone's media capabilities
and require an online connection. Custom mobile applications are
difficult to develop and distribute. To address these limitations
we present CAM - a new framework for developing and deploying mobile
computing applications in the rural developing world. CAM applications
are accessed by capturing barcodes using the mobile phone camera,
or entering numeric strings with the keypad. Supporting minimal navigation,
direct linkage to paper practices and offline multi-media interaction,
CAM is uniquely adapted to rural device, user and infrastructure
constraints. To illustrate the breadth of the framework, we list
a number of CAM-based applications that we have implemented or are
planning. These include processing microfinance loans, facilitating
rural supply chains, documenting grassroots innovation and accessing
electronic medical histories.
