Prime III: a user centered voting system
Mr. Wilson never votes. He doesn't vote because he is not confident
in his reading capabilities; however, he decided that he will vote
this year because he heard that blind people will be able to privately
cast their vote. He said, "If blind people can vote, then so can
I" At the voting precinct, he shows his identification and receives
a blank, numbered ballot sheet. He enters a voting booth, placing
the ballot into the printer. Using a headset with a microphone, he
is able to make his selections by speaking numbers, which gives him
confidence that his vote is private. Before printing his ballot,
he listens to a summary of his selections. He leaves the voting booth
and places his printed ballot into a secure box. Like Mr. Wilson,
there are millions of people that don't participate in our electoral
process due to disabilities and lack of confidence in the equipment.
Through usable security, Prime III aims to broaden voter participation
and confidence.
