Designing and managing virtual learning communities
There is a tendency to view education on the Internet as simply a
more efficient way to access information and to communicate, but
the Internet is much more than just another tool. The Internet has
the potential to create communities where students participate in
robust discourse and rituals of communication, establish their identities,
and traverse community boundaries. We believe we need to design on-line
courses with sound pedagogical frameworks and with a sense of promoting
community values of diversity, connectedness, and civic responsibility.
Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to describe a framework that
we use to design virtual learning communities. We explain community
activities to consider, describe how we used our framework for designing
three classes, and pose issues that arose when using this framework.
We hope our thoughts will direct discussion toward the creation of
innovative learning communities
