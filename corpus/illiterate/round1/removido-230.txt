Automatic verification on the large
An automatic verification method from a high level resource management
standpoint is presented. Various manipulators can be incorporated
in the method to construct, refine, reduce, and model-check state
space representation. Proper combinations of manipulators can then
be picked strategically by users or computers for less resource (time
and space) consumption. An algorithm based on group theory to pick
a manipulator combination is presented. Verification sessions are
conducted to illustrate our idea
