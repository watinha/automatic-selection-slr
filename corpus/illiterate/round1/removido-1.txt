Deleting the Subject: A Feminist Reading of Epistemology in Artificial
Intelligence
This paper argues that AI follows classical versions of epistemology
in assuming that the identity of the knowing subject is not important.
In other words this serves to `delete the subject'. This disguises
an implicit hierarchy of knowers involved in the representation of
knowledge in AI which privileges the perspective of those who design
and build the systems over alternative perspectives. The privileged
position reflects Western, professional masculinity. Alternative
perspectives, denied a voice, belong to less powerful groups including
women. Feminist epistemology can be used to approach this from new
directions, in particular, to show how women's knowledge may be left
out of consideration by AI's focus on masculine subjects. The paper
uncovers the tacitly assumed Western professional male subjects in
two flagship AI systems, Cyc and Soar.
