Designing Web-based Forms for Users with Lower Literacy Skills
Previous research (Summers & Summers, 2003) has identified patterns 	of behavior and effective practices related to how lower literacy 	users interact with health-related Internet sites. However, prior 	research has not addressed how such users react to the unique challenges 	represented by interactive medical forms on health sites, such as 	interactive health quizzes, questionnaires, and registration forms. 	The goal of this four-month study was twofold: 1) to identify reading, 	writing, and navigational strategies of users with lower literacy 	skills when interacting with web-based forms in a medical context; 	2) to develop design principles for making such web-based medical 	forms usable and accessible for lower-literacy adults. Eyetracking 	was used to gather data about how users interacted with a variety 	of web-based forms. Analysis of sessions with 26 low-literacy users 	(REALM score < 60) identified a variety of challenges users faced 	in completing forms. Based on these observations, proposed principles 	of effective form design were developed. Revised prototype forms 	were designed in accordance with these principles and iteratively 	tested with 14 users to verify improved usability.
