Security broker for multimedia wireless LANs: design, implementation
and testbed
To secure interactive multimedia applications in wireless LANs (WLANs)
it is pertinent to implement a number of security services such as
authentication, key exchange and real-time encryption/decryption.
WLANs, though, present a complex and challenging environment for
implementing such security services since these services may deplete
the limited network resources and increase the burden of supporting
quality of service for multimedia applications. Consequently, a broker
is needed to mediate proper security considering inputs such as user
security requirements, user security literacy, available network
resources, and security routines performance. In this paper we introduce
a security broker that we have designed to fulfil these complex mediation
needs. This broker is implemented in software and tested in a wireless
LAN testbed. The reported security broker design and implementation
considers the wireless LAN environment as well as the multimedia
applications' quality of service requirements such as delay and throughput.
We also introduce an inline encryption/decryption software that encrypts/decrypts
traffic on the fly. Our experiments show that in cases where relatively
modern computers are used with properly chosen standard encryptors,
then such computers can sustain the throughput and security requirements
of interactive multimedia applications for WLANs such as telephone-quality
audio, video conferencing, and MPEG video
