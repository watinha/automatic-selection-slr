Dynamic Taxonomies: A Model for Large Information Bases
AbstractÂ¿A new taxonomic model for structuring and accessing large 	heterogeneous information bases is presented. The model is designed 	to simplify both classification and access by computer-illiterate 	people. It defines simple and intuitive operations to access large 	information bases at the conceptual level and at different levels 	of abstraction, in a totally assisted way, through a simple, yet 	effective visual interface. The model can also be used to summarize 	result sets computed by other query methods, such as information 	retrieval, shape retrieval, etc., and to provide user maps for complex 	hypermedia networks. The experience gained by applying this model 	to commercial applications is reported.
