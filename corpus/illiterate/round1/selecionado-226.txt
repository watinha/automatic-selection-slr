Designing an e-government portal accessible to illiterate citizens
The digital battle has become the most important factor of economic 	and social development. In fact, there is no doubt on the fact that 	establishing E-government systems can improve the quality of government 	services and enhance the citizens' life. However, E-government projects 	cannot be successful if they are not adapted to the specific cultural 	and social needs of the users.   	Taking into consideration the high illiteracy rate within the Moroccan 	population, we conducted our research to design an E-government portal 	for the old city of Fez that is accessible by the majority of the 	citizens especially those who are illiterate.   	The objective of this research is exploring the different architectures, 	scenarios and technologies for designing an E-government portal that 	is usable and accessible by all Fez citizens whether they are literate 	or illiterate. Hence, the concrete output of this project is a usable 	graphical user interface accessible to both literate and illiterate 	people in order for them to interact with the static content and 	to use the online transactions. In the process of achieving our goal, 	we had to discover and create design principles and to test them 	with real users.   	This paper describes and justifies the chosen methodology, architecture 	and tools that were applied in order to develop Fez e-government 	portal's graphical user interface. The results of the designed graphical 	user interface's testing are presented and discussed in order to 	assess the project's success.
