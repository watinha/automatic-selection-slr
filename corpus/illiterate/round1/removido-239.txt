The development of mobile applications for patient education
The International Centre for Digital Content explores the relationship
of technology to societyóthrough present and emerging applications.
This paper outlines ICDCís rapid application development methodology,
focusing specifically on a current project partnership with Healthcare
Services. The aim of this project is to provide the Primary Care
Group (PCG) healthcare specialists with a suite of interoperable
devices that can provide breast cancer patients with personalized
educational information at any point throughout the course of their
treatment. The first phase of the project focuses on the development
of a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) prototype. The patient will
have access to educational multimedia content relating to their condition
at any time and in any context.
