Enhancing learning and teaching quality: Intranet hierarchy optimisation 	and application of stereochemical molecular representations
This article deals with the ongoing use and development of Intranet-based 	technologies within the School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, 	University of Brighton. The course used as a test model is the M.Pharm. 	degree, a 4-year course with approximately 120 students per level. 	The student subjects of this study are the then Level 2 students. 	In this article we examine the continued optimisation of a School 	Intranet learning resource with regard to optimisation of the hierarchical 	structure. In response to a requirement previously identified, this 	work then focuses on the use of manipulatable molecular representations 	to enhance the learning and teaching of stereochemistry.
