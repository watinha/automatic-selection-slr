Computer use has no demonstrated impact on the well-being of older 	adults
Technology is frequently presented as a panacea for the support needs 	of the ageing population, based in part upon the commonly cited assertion 	that computer and internet use has an empirically verified positive 	effect on the well-being of older people. In this paper we review 	the studies that this assertion is based on and conclude that they 	do not support it. While the original studies rarely make unsupportable 	claims, the secondary literature which cites them is frequently very 	misleading; limitations include, failure to distinguish between the 	effects of training/support and computer use; misattributing causality; 	inappropriately generalising results from a different population.
