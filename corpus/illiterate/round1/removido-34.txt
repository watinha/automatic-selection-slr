Community Support for Constructionist Learning
MOOSE Crossing is a text-based virtual reality environment (or “MUD”) 	designed to be a constructionist learning environment for children 	ages eight to thirteen. The constructionist philosophy of education 	argues that learning through designing and constructing personally 	meaningful projects is better than learning by being told. Children 	on MOOSE Crossing learn computer programming and improve their reading 	and writing by working on self-selected projects in a self-motivated, 	peer-supported fashion. In experience with over 180 children and 	90 adults using the system since October 1995, we have found that 	the community provides essential support for the children‘s learning 	experiences. The community provides role models; situated, ubiquitous 	project models; emotional support to overcome technophobia; technical 	support; and an appreciative audience for completed work. This paper 	examines the nature of that support in detail, and argues that community 	support for learning is an essential element in collaborative work 	and learning on the Internet.
