Should we bridge the gap by outsourcing part of faculty support
Some faculty members seek to push the technology envelope further
and faster than Computing Centers can respond to or support. Should
we encourage some of our faculty to meet their needs outside of university
resources at their own expense? Should we support this move with
training, referrals, and backup support when necessary? Should we
encourage a faculty member to register a domain name, create a website,
and refer students and others to their own domain names and sub-domains
for each class? With the right web-hosting service, they could create
and manage their own discussion lists. This paper will discuss various
web-hosting services, what they offer, and how faculty might use
them.
