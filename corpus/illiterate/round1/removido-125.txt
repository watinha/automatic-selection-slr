Community Participation in Health Informatics inAfrica: An Experiment 	in Tripartite Partnership inIle-Ife, Nigeria
Participatory Design has mainly been practiced in Europe and North 	America. Our seven-year experience in Nigeria suggests that user 	participation is also a must in developing countries. However, the 	scope of participation needs to be expanded. For instance, in health 	informatics the communities served by the health facility in question 	need to be involved along with computer professionals and health 	providers. This paper presents the results of an experiment in tripartite 	partnership in systems design for Primary Health Care by designers, 	users/providers, and community representatives in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. 	The experience was extremely encouraging.
