Providing voice connectivity to rural India using WiMAX: issues and 	solution
The need of emerging markets telecom, specifically in the Indian telecom 	scenario, WiMAX is being looked as a broadband access solution ahead 	of LTE and other competing technologies due its long range and high 	bandwidth. Voice Over IP (VoIP) will potentially be the killer application 	for emerging market like India. In this paper we propose a Kiosk 	based WiMAX infrastructure model to provide voice connectivity to 	rural Indian villages. In the proposed kiosk model, plain old telephones 	are connected to a WiMAX subscriber station using Foreign Exchange 	Subscriber and a Media Gateway. The novelty of the kiosk based infrastructure 	models is that it has low deployment cost from a service provider 	perspective, and almost negligible equipment cost for the end user.   	In order to make the kiosk based model economically sustainable, the 	number of simultaneous voice calls that can be supported over the 	WiMAX subscriber stations needs to be maximized. To this end, the 	paper proposes a Dynamic Frame Profile algorithm to maximize the 	number of VoIP calls supported over a single subscriber station. 	A performance evaluation of the the proposed Dynamic Frame Profile 	algorithm is also carried out to study its effectiveness and reported 	in this paper.
