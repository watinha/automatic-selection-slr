A system to break the 2R barrier between man and machine
By 2R, we mean the Radicals and Roman spelling of the Chinese language.
They form a high barrier between man and machine that makes use of
the 2R. A system has been developed by recognizing the four basic
patterns (4BP) of Chinese characters. With the 4BP, we can build
character codes and word codes of the Chinese language. Since the
4BP (squares, horizontal, vertical and miscellaneous [non-straight]
strokes) can be recognized easily by anyone, be they Chinese or non-Chinese,
there would be no barrier between a man and machine that makes use
of the 4BP codes. By such means, Chinese culture could be extended
to every corner of the world in a not distant future
