Archeoguide: first results of an augmented reality, mobile computing 	system in cultural heritage sites
This paper presents the ARCHEOGUIDE project (Augmented Reality-based 	Cultural Heritage On-site GUIDE). ARCHEOGUIDE is an IST project, 	funded by the EU, aiming at providing a personalized electronic guide 	and tour assistant to cultural site visitors. The system provides 	on-site help and Augmented Reality reconstructions of ancient ruins, 	based on user's position and orientation in the cultural site, and 	realtime image rendering. It incorporates a multimedia database of 	cultural material for on-line access to cultural data, virtual visits, 	and restoration information. It uses multi-modal user interfaces 	and personalizes the flow of information to its user's profile in 	order to cater for both professional and recreational users, and 	for applications ranging from archaeological research, to education, 	multimedia publishing, and cultural tourism. This paper presents 	the ARCHEOGUIDE system and the experiences gained from the evaluation 	of an initial prototype by representative user groups at the archeological 	site of Olympia, Greece.
