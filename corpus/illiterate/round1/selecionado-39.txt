VoiceList: user-driven telephone-based audio content
We present VoiceList, a telephone-based user-generated audio classifieds
service. The aim of the system is to provide an infrastructure for
a user-driven community service where there is minimal connectivity
to the Internet. Our approach takes advantage of prior knowledge
and the ubiquitous presence of telephones in developing nations,
overcoming literacy and connectivity barriers.
