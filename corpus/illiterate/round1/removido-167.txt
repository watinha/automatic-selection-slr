Using mobile phones for secure, distributed document processing in
the developing world
Paper plays an essential role in many information ecologies in the
developing world, but it can be inefficient and inflexible. We've
developed an information services architecture that uses a smart
phone equipped with a built-in digital camera to process augmented
paper documents. The CAM document-processing framework exploits smart
mobile phones' utility, usability, and growing ubiquity to link paper
with modern information tools. CAM, so called because the phone's
camera plays a key role in the user interface, is a three-tiered,
document-based architecture for providing remote rural information
services. The CAM framework comprises four components: CamForms,
CamShell, CamBrowser, and CamServer.
