iShakti--Crossing the Digital Divide in Rural India
This paper describes iShakti, a real-world, Intelligent, Interactive
and Adaptive Web application. At present, iShakti is deployed across
1000 rural kiosks in India, covering 5000 villages and reaching 1
million people. Further scale up is underway, expected to cover tens
of thousands of villages within the next 2 years. iShakti is a "virtual
information and marketing channel', deploying leading-edge technology
in a developing-world environment. It allows rich interactions with
people in previously "mediadark' regions, with easy access to high-value
community development services coupled with engaging and scalable
market and brand development activities. The impact is already being
felt -- iShakti is giving some of the most deprived and disempowered
people more choice and control over their lives, and providing significant
independent revenue for the iShakti entrepreneurs. Computational
Intelligence is both in the design as well as the personalisation
and synchronisation algorithms. The project was nominated as a finalist
of the Stockholm Challenge (Economic Development category), an international
award for ICT projects in "underserved' regions of the world [1].
