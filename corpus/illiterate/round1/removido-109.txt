A Scalable Toolkit for Designing Multimedia Authoring Environments
This paper introduces Kaomi, a scalable toolkit for designing authoring 	environments of multimedia documents. The underlying concept is to 	provide the designer of multimedia applications with a fast method 	to get an authoring system based on a set of synchronized views (the 	presentation view for displaying the document, the scenario view 	for showing the temporal organization of the document, &mldr;) so 	that each view is the support of editing actions. Kaomi is flexible 	enough to support a variety of multimedia documents declarative formats. 	It is indeed a scalable toolkit since it provides facilities for 	extending and/or for modifying the resulting authoring environment. 	In addition, cross-platform portability is provided which allows 	operation in the heterogenous Internet environment. The use of Kaomi 	is mainly described through the design of two authoring environments: 	one for authoring a sub-set of the Smil standard of the W3C and the 	other one for Madeus, a constraint based multimedia language.
