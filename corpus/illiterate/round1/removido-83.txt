Evaluating users' experience of a character-enhanced information 	space
We created the characters Agneta & Frida with the intent to strengthen 	and encourage exploration of information spaces. In a follow&dash;up 	study we tried to capture whether users found the characters believable, 	whether they raised affective responses in users, and whether they 	created a richer, more narratively oriented, experience of the space. 	In order to do so, we had to develop new criteria and methods of 	understanding users' conceptions and affective responses. We discuss 	the study in detail, as well as the general implications for how 	to perform user studies and design of character&dash;enhanced systems.
