Intestinal parasitic diseases in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: prevalence, 	sociodemographic and environmental associates
SummaryOur objectives were to assess the prevalence of intestinal 	parasitic infections in Riyadh and to determine associated sociodemographic 	and environmental factors. The study was conducted through a household 	survey. Three health centres were chosen from each of the five Riyadh 	urban regions and 15 from rural areas. Based on the average family 	size, a random sample of households were chosen. All household members 	were asked to participate in the study. Data were collected using 	a pre-designed questionnaire eliciting data on sociodemographic and 	environmental factors. A stool specimen of each individual was examined 	microscopically for the presence of trophozoites and cysts. Six thousand 	and twelve participants with a mean age of 23.3 ± 17.4 (median 19 	years, 48.6% males) were studied and 32.2% were infected. The infection 	rate was high in urban areas (33.3%), among children <12 years (34.4%), 	non-Saudis (42.2%), single persons (34.9%), illiterate individuals 	(33.8%), those who obtained drinking water from tankers (36.1%) and 	those who disposed of sewage in open channels (47.1%). Stratified 	analysis showed that for Saudis <12 years parasitic infections were 	significantly higher among tanker users (39.5%) and septic tank users 	(36.8%). For Saudis≥12 years low education, water storage and open 	sewage disposal were statistically associated with parasitic infections 	(P < 0.05). Among expatriates, infections were high among males (47.6%), 	urban residents (48.3%), single persons (46.9%), tanker users (39.5%) 	and septic tank users (78.6%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis 	showed that age <12 years, non-Saudi nationalities, educational level 	below secondary school, tanker as source of water and open sewage 	disposal were independently associated with high intestinal parasitic 	infection.
