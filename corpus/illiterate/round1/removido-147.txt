Integrating data from disparate sources: a mass collaboration approach
The rapid growth of distributed data at enterprises and on the WWW 	has fueled significant interest in building data integration systems. 	Such a system provides users with a uniform query interface (called 	mediated schema) to a multitude of data sources, thus freeing them 	from manually querying each individual source. To address some problems 	in the MOBS (Mass Collaboration to Build Systems) project at the 	University of Illinois, we develop solutions that learn from the 	multitude of users in the integration environment to improve the 	accuracy of integration tools. The improved accuracy in turn can 	significantly reduce the workload of the system builder. In developing 	MOBS we address the following key challenges: (i) obtaining user 	participation, (ii) learning from user participation, and (iii) combining 	user answers.
