Globetoddler: designing for remote interaction between preschoolers
and their traveling parents
In recent decades, families in the Western world have become more
geographically distributed, making it more difficult for family members
to achieve and maintain a feeling of connectedness. Different time
zones and contexts and a limited awareness of the other family members'
availability and mood are some of many factors that make "being together"
more challenging when physically apart. Besides, when it comes to
preschool children, existing communication technologies, such as
phones and computers, may not even be an option. As a result, many
families simply accept the fact that being apart leads to fragmented,
or even non-existent, interaction. In this paper we describe initial
work on a tangible system, Globetoddler, which aims to make remote
interaction between preschool children and their traveling parents
easy and enjoyable. The paper describes the process of defining design
principles for this system, as well as the content and implications
of these principles.
