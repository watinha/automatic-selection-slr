Exploring the feasibility of video mail for illiterate users
We present work that explores whether the asynchronous peer-to-peer
communication capabilities of email can be made accessible to illiterate
populations in the developing world. Building on metaphors from traditional
communication systems such as postal mail, and relevant design principles
established by previous research into text-free interfaces, we designed
and evaluated a prototype asynchronous communication application
built on standard email protocols. We considered different message
formats -- text, freeform ink, audio, and video + audio -- and via
iterative usage and design sessions, determined that video + audio
was the most viable. Design alternatives for authentication processes
were also explored. Our prototype was refined over three usability
iterations, and the final version evaluated in a two-stage study
with 20 illiterate users from an urban slum in Bangalore, India.
Our results are mixed: On the one hand, the results show that users
can understand the concept of video mail. They were able to successfully
complete tasks ranging from account setup to login to viewing and
creating mail, but required assistance from an online audio assistant.
On the other hand, there were some surprising challenges such as
a consistent difficulty understanding the notion of asynchronicity.
The latter suggests that more work on the paradigm is required before
the benefits of email can be brought to illiterate users.
