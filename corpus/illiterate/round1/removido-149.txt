Towards accessible semantic web applications
The importance for Web applications to reach all kind of potential
users and customers is being stressed by companies and public sectors.
The standardization initiative for Web applications, WAI and the
Universal Design framework establish useful rules for building accessible
applications for any kind of disabled and non-disabled users. The
proliferation of Semantic Web technologies and formal ontologies
offer a technological opportunity for establishing automatic and
advanced methods for accessible Web applications. In this work we
introduce a method for publishing Semantic Web content that establishes
separated stages for content selection and its presentation, through
Semantic Portal. We are applying some of those principles to a portal
devoted to international affairs.
