Global connectivity through wireless network technology\&\#58; a
possible solution for poor countries
There has always been an unequal access to technology among demographically,
economically, and socially diverse groups. However, mobile technology
seems to be defying diversity obstacles. The present study investigates
the factors that may contribute to the prosperity of mobile technology;
especially, socio-economic factors, telecom infrastructures, and
internet use. Statistical analyses show that there is an empirical
relationship between these factors and the growth of mobile technology.
The factors analysed reveal that, unlike other technologies, mobile
technology has been growing faster in economically and technologically
challenged nations; and therefore, mobile technology may be the best
tool to overcome internet connectivity problems in poor countries.
