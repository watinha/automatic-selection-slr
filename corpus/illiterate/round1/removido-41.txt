Challenges to e-government in Africa south of Sahara: a critical 	view, and provisional notes for a research agenda
In this paper, we attempt to address the broader question as to why 	in Africa, e-government projects in general have higher rate of failure 	than success. Based on documentary analysis and using the information 	ecology framework, we critically analyze the case of The Gambia as 	e-government prototype country selected by the Economic Commission 	for Africa. We further discuss the value assumptions and implications, 	and propose an approach that will include value sensitive design 	as a way to address the designreality gap in order to minimize the 	risks for failure. In the process, a number of questions, issues 	and challenges are identified as possible foci for future research.
