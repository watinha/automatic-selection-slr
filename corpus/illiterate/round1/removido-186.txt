The knowledge contribution of engineers to software development: 	a case study
The focus of the authors is on the domain knowledge advantage of end 	user prototyping (EUP). The authors present the case history of an 	industrial engineer in an aluminum manufacturing company who becomes 	a sophisticated user of microcomputers and successfully prototypes 	an expert decision support system. Previous work in the field is 	extended and enhanced, and how EUP builds upon the domain knowledge 	possessed by end users, and thereby overcomes the domain knowledge 	deficiency of software engineers, is demonstrated. When compared 	to rapid prototyping by software engineers, prototyping by end users 	enables more effective utilization of domain knowledge
