SiMPE: third workshop on speech in mobile and pervasive environments
In the past, voice-based applications have been accessed using unintelligent
telephone devices through Voice Browsers that reside on the server.
The proliferation of pervasive devices and the increase in their
processing capabilities, clientside speech processing has been emerging
as a viable alternative. In SiMPE 2008, the third in the series,
we will continue to explore the various possibilities and issues
that arise while enabling speech processing on resource-constrained,
possibly mobile devices.


In SiMPE 2007 [2], the focus was on developing regions. Given the
importance of speech in developing regions, SiMPE 2008 will include
"SiMPE for developing regions" as a topic of interest. As a result
of discussions in SiMPE 2007, we plan to invite and encourage Speech
UI designers to participate in SiMPE 2008. We will also review the
progress made over the last two years, in the areas and key problems
identified in SiMPE 2006 [3].
