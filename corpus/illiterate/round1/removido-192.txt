WELL done and well liked: online information literacy skills and
learner impressions of the web as a resource for foreign language
learning
One of the most common uses of the World Wide Web for foreign language
learning is as a resource for students to find information when researching
essay topics. When language instructors ask students to perform searches
for information about a given issue it is assumed that students know
how to perform those searches and appreciate the usefulness of the
Web. However, we do not really know much about the relationship between
learners and the Web: what processes are involved, how the students
go about the search process and what their perceptions of the Web
are. It is therefore essential that these assumptions are examined
and researched. To find out more about these questions, a study was
initiated with the aim of obtaining information on how foreign language
higher education students interact with the Web in general and in
the context of a search for content/reading tasks in particular.
The goal was to produce a descriptive snapshot of student impressions
and abilities at one given moment. For this purpose 198 students
of Spanish at the University of Southampton were asked how they use
the Web, what for, how they go about finding the information they
need, what they perceive to be the advantages and disadvantages of
using the Web as a research tool for language learning, to compare
it to other resources and what their perceptions of it are. To measure
their degree of online information literacy, a scale was created.
In this paper the details of the project will be presented, and the
findings of the study discussed.
