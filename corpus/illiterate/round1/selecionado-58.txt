The talking touchscreen: A new approach to outcomes assessment in 	low literacy
Purpose. Cancer patients who are deficient in literacy skills are 	particularly vulnerable to experiencing different outcomes due to 	disparities in care or barriers to care. Outcomes measurement in 	low literacy patients may provide new insight into problems previously 	undetected due to the challenges of completing paper-and-pencil forms.  	Description of study. A multimedia program was developed to provide 	a quality of life assessment platform that would be acceptable to 	patients with varying literacy skills and computer experience. One 	item at a time is presented on the computer touchscreen, accompanied 	by a recorded reading of the question. Various colors, fonts and 	graphic images are used to enhance visibility, and a small picture 	icon appears near each text element allowing patients to replay the 	sound as many times as they wish. Evaluation questions are presented 	to assess patient burden and preferences.  	Results. An ethnically diverse group of 126 cancer patients with a 	range of literacy skills and computer experience reported that the 	talking touchscreen (TT) was easy to use, and commented on the usefulness 	of the multimedia approach.  	Clinical implications. The TT is a practical, user-friendly data acquisition 	method that provides greater opportunities to measure self-reported 	outcomes in patients with a range of literacy skills.
