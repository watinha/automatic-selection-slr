A pervasive wiki application based on VoiceXML
In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of an audio
wiki application accessible via the Public Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN) and the Internet for educational purposes. The application
exploits mature World Wide Web Consortium standards such as VoiceXML,
Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) and Speech Recognition Grammar
Specification (SRGS). The purpose of such an application is to assist
visually impaired, technologically uneducated, and underprivileged
people in accessing information originally intended to be accessed
visually via a Personal Computer. Users may access wiki content via
wired or mobile phones, or via a Personal Computer using a Web Browser
or a Voice over IP service. This feature promotes pervasiveness to
educational material to an extremely large population, i.e. those
who simply own a telephone line.
