A Picture Language Translator
Picture languages are on attractive basis for communication. However, 	it is difficult to represent and understand accurate meaning in such 	languages. So, we are developing an approach where pictures with 	captions are allocated on positions of a 2D structure and special 	translators generate corresponding sentences in natural languages. 	These positions have pre-defined meaning and represent a multimedia 	hieroglyph. The hieroglyph is a complex picture (a multimedia sentence) 	including more simple pictures (multimedia words). In this approach 	the "hieroglyphic writing" is reduced to selecting appropriate multimedia 	words through special interface panels without necessity to use keyboards. 	As a result, the users can send and receive multimedia messages, 	though they have never used a computer before. In this paper, methods 	and implementation techniques for translating multimedia hieroglyphs 	into English are explained
