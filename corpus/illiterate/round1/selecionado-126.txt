VOISERV: Creation and Delivery of Converged Services through Voice
for Emerging Economies
WWW has made information accessible to computer users in various ways
not imagined before. However; there is a huge pool ofpeople, especially
in emerging economies, still untouched by this revolution and are
either unaware of, or are unable or to join this bandwagon. Mobile
phones are increasingly empowering the under-privileged to utilize
data and services beyond the basic voice communication. However;
factors such as high illiteracy rate, cost sensitivity, and user
interface issues prevent these users from deriving benefits of available
infrastructure and services. We have developed a novel system Â¿
VOISERV that enables ordinary telephone subscribers to create, deploy
and offer their own customized voice-driven applications called Voic-eSites.
The generated VoiceSites get hosted in the network for low cost of
ownership and maintenance, and are integrated with advanced services
available in the converged networks of today.
