Vital physiological signs monitoring
The aim of this project is to build a virtual image and the patients'
data and signal transfer to a remote place. Patient information will
be available to those who have the authority to access the information.
LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) is
used in displaying the signal in the computer. Virtual instruments
are created in order to acquire the electrocardiograph (ECG) signal.
LabVIEW gives the flexibility of a powerful programming language
without the associated difficulty and complexity because its graphical
programming methodology is inherently intuitive. Another signal,
oxygen saturation (SpO2), is acquired through serial connection of
the equipment to the computer. This project aspires to create links
for the communication between healthcare practitioners in discussing
the patients' data and situation.
