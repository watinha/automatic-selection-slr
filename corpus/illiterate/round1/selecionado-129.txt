WWTW: the world wide telecom web
The World Wide Web (WWW) enabled quick and easy information dissemination 	and brought about fundamental changes to various aspects of our lives. 	However, a very large number of people, mostly in developing regions, 	are still untouched by this revolution. Compared to PCs, the primary 	access mechanism to WWW, mobile phones have made a phenomenal penetration 	into this population segment. Low cost of ownership, the simple user 	interface consisting of a small keyboard, limited menu and voice-based 	access contribute to the success of mobile phones with the less literate. 	However, apart from basic voice communication, these people are not 	being able to exploit the benefits of information and services available 	to WWW users.   	In this paper, we present the World Wide Telecom Web (WWTW) --- our 	vision of a voice-driven ecosystem parallel to that of the WWW. WWTW 	is a network of interconnected voice sites that are voice driven 	applications created by users and hosted in the network. It has the 	potential to enable the underprivileged population to become a part 	of the next generation converged networked world. We present a whole 	gamut of existing technology enablers for our vision as well as present 	research directions and open challenges that need to be solved to 	not only realize a WWTW but also to enable the two Webs to cross 	leverage each other.
