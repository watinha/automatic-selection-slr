Glamour and Honor: Going Online and Reading in West African Culture
In the fragile reading cultures of the developing world, will people
abandon print as they embrace the Internet? Whether media compete
or collaborate depends on place-specific factors. West Africans insert
online practices into a local context of material circumstances,
social roles, and cultural values. In Nigeria and Ghana these include
(1) unreliable electricity and execrable telephone service; (2) overworked
women, jobless young men, scammers, and ambitious teenagers; and
(3) a reading culture of limited penetration but enormous prestige.
Internet access via cybercafés has intensified personal communications,
reinforced gender inequality, and enabled petty crooks to go global.
It has not, however, encroached on reading's all-but-sacred status.
Both netsavvy youth and the adult “reading class” protect reading
practices through spatial and temporal separation, time management,
and functional differentiation. These preserve the honored position
of reading despite West Africans' enthusiasm for the glamour of going
online.
