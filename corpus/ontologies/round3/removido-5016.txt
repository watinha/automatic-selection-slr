Automatic Combination Technology of Fuzzy CPN for OWL-S Web Services in Supercomputing Cloud Platform
Supercomputing Cloud Platform (SCP) provides a simple online Web way for computer aided engineering (CAE) simulation on supercomputer Tianhe No.1. We develop SCP prototype by using service-oriented architecture (SOA). Fuzzy colored Petri nets (FCPN) is selected as the automatic combination technology for the Ontology Web Language for Services (OWL-S) in our SCP. To build the dependency relation graphs among Web services in our SCP, we put forward some definitions of semantic threshold similarity for Web services. Based on these definitions, we propose a generation algorithm to build the FCPN dependency relation graph based on semantic similarity of Web services, and analyze an example about this algorithm. Also, we design an algorithm to simplify the FCPN dependency relation graph for fast responding the user's requirements. The research works of this paper (SCP prototype) have been applied in real world, and we show the engineering design and application at the end. We will further research the service verification, transaction model and exception recovery mechanism in the future.
