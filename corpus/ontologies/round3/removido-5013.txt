Automation of Operator Oriented Code Coverage using Mutation Testing
Abstract- Mutation testing does not take a path-based approach. Instead, it takes the program and creates many mutants  of it, by making simple changes to the program. The goal of testing is to make sure that during the course of testing; each  mutant produces an output different from the output of the original program. We have designed a Tool to work Mutation  Testing. The mutation testing is performed in terms of some substitutions in terms of operators. In this proposed work we  have considered java as the base language to test the code. As the language is object oriented language. In this proposed  work we have worked with two major types of operators. One is Class operators and other is Class Operators.
