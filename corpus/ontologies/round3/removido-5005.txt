A process for the representation of openEHR ADL archetypes in OWL ontologies
Abstract
ADL is a formal language to express archetypes, it is
independent of standard or domain. However its specification
is not precise enough in relation to the specialization and
semantic of archetypes, presenting difficulties in
implementation and a few available tools. Archetypes may be
implemented using other languages such as XML or OWL,
increasing integration with Semantic Web tools [3, 4].
Exchanging and data transformation processes can be better
implemented with semantcs oriented models, for example
using OWL [1] which is a language to define and instantiate
Web ontologies defined by W3C. OWL permits to define
significant, detailed, precise and consistent distinctions
among classes, properties and relations defined by the user,
ensuring the consistency of knowledge than using ADL
techniques. In this paper it is presented a process of an
openEHR ADL archetypes representation in OWL ontologies.
This process consists of ADL archetypes conversion in OWL
ontologies and validation of OWL resultant ontologies using
the mutation test.
