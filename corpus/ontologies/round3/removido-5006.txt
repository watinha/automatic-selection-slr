Automated Mutation-Based Test Case Evaluation for Semantic Web Services
Abstract:  Semantic Web Services (SWS) introduce a semantic layer to the current web infrastructure, enabling the automated processing of web service tasks. In the past decade, various frameworks have been proposed for designing SWS. However, few of them aimed at testing SWS. Generating test cases for SWS is challenging due to its dynamic nature and abstract views, evaluating the test cases is equally essential in order to ensure the quality of the test suite. In this paper, we propose a mutation based evaluation approach to measuring the quality of test cases for SWS. Furthermore, we develop a tool support to automate the steps in the proposed solution. Finally, the approach is applied to the Amazon E-Commerce Service as a real world case study.
