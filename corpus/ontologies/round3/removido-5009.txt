MuTomVo: Mutation Testing framework for omnet-based simulated enVironments
Abstract
Currently, testing is the most widely used technique to check the validity of complex
systems. Its application in software is a critical part in the development of systems. However,
there are several difficulties for applying these techniques, such as high economic
and computational cost. One of the main difficulties when applying testing techniques is
to obtain an appropriate test suite. This is especially difficult when the size of the system
under test is large, like HPC clusters or cloud systems.
The main goal of this project is to provide mechanisms that allow to evaluate the suitability
of test suites to check distributed systems, in an inexpensive and efficient way. In
this work, we propose MuTomVo, a framework that integrates mutation testing techniques
with simulation techniques. For modelling and simulating distributed systems, the SIMCAN
simulation platform has been used.
MuTomVo is built on a modular and flexible architecture, where new mutation testing
techniques can be easily included. Thus, it is intended to unify, in one framework, functionalities
of different tools, such as simulators, mutation frameworks and tools for generating
tests.
Moreover, this work presents some experiments for analysing the suitability of different
test suites over different distributed applications. Each one of these applications has been
modelled with SIMCAN, and therefore, these experiments have been carried out by applying
mutation testing techniques on these models.
