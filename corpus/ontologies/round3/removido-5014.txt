A Reliability Calculation Method for Web Service Composition Using Fuzzy Reasoning Colored Petri Nets and Its Application on Supercomputing Cloud Platform
Abstract: In order to develop a Supercomputing Cloud Platform (SCP) prototype system using Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Petri nets, we researched some technologies for Web service composition. Specifically, in this paper, we propose a reliability calculation method for Web service compositions, which uses Fuzzy Reasoning Colored Petri Net (FRCPN) to verify the Web service compositions. We put forward a definition of semantic threshold similarity for Web services and a formal definition of FRCPN. We analyzed five kinds of production rules in FRCPN, and applied our method to the SCP prototype. We obtained the reliability value of the end Web service as an indicator of the overall reliability of the FRCPN. The method can test the activity of FRCPN. Experimental results show that the reliability of the Web service composition has a correlation with the number of Web services and the range of reliability transition values.
