Test Reconfiguration for Service Oriented Applications
Abstract:  Software testing in a service oriented and/or cloud computing environment is made challenging by its dynamic and loosely coupled nature. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a methodology for capturing changes and reconfiguring test data for an atomic service based on changes in the WSDL service description. Based on our results we believe that our technique can be extended further to capture changes in composite services and services that run on the Software as a Service (SaaS) platform in cloud computing.
