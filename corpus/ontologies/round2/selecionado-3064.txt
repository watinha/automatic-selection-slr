Validation of ontology based test case generation for graphical user interface
Abstract:  Testing is an important phase during the development cycle of software. Generating test cases is an important activity during this phase. TCG for GUI is a least focused area and the techniques which are being used in Command Line Interface do not fit here. One of the means to formally represent knowledge is through ontology. It represents domain information as a set of concepts and relationship among them. Ontology based GUI testing is a new branch of testing. To validate the framework for generating test case based on ontology an experiment has been conducted.
