OCL-Based Testing for E-Learning Web Service
Abstract
As testing has been playing an important role in guaranteeing quality of Web service in respect of E-learning, the traditional testing of Web services presents its inability such as time-consuming and flawed testing procedures as opposed to desired measures in quickly and thoroughly scanning Web services for detects. To reduce testing cost and enhance testing efficiency, our testing measure for E-learning Web services is to describe services with an annotation mixed with the Object Constrain Language (OCL) and Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML Schema (SAWSDL), parse OCL pre-conditions and OCL post-conditions, and generate test cases with class division and boundary values. An experimental case indicates the feasibility of the proposed approach.
