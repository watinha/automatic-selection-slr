An extension to BPEL for criteria-based web service composition
Abstract
In our earlier work, we defined criteria-based web service (CBWS) as a service which has 'criteria' associated with it. Criteria are a set of properties and are a part of non-functional properties (NFPs) of a service. Composite web services invoke one or more additional web services and combine their functionality to fulfil the user's requirement. In this paper, we propose that a composite service be able to invoke CBWS. To support this, our proposed approach is to extend the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) to extended BPEL (X-BPEL) by introducing new activities which help to get the criteria information from the user before invoking CBWS. It is possible that more than one CBWS satisfies the criteria specified by the user. Upon finding these services, the user is given this list of web services to choose any one of them. This dialogue is supported by new activities in X-BPEL. The extensions are defined in the X-BPEL schema.
