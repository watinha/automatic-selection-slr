Abstract:
With the fast advance of cloud computing, developing software-as-a-service (SaaS) is becoming a hot topic in cloud computing and engineering. Due to new features of SaaS applications, SaaS testing becomes an interesting hot topic for both industry and research communities. Although there are a number of published papers discussing cloud testing, there is a lack of research papers addressing new issues, challenges, and needs in SaaS testing. This paper provides a tutorial to discuss SaaS testing, including its concepts, focuses and objective, test process, test environments, and requirements.
