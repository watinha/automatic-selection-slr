A Systematic Mapping Study on the Multi-tenant Architecture of SaaS Systems
Abstract Background: SaaS (Software as a Service) is a services
delivery model in Cloud Computing whose applications are remotely
hosted by the service provider and available to customers
on demand over the Internet. Multi-tenant Architecture (MTA) is
an organizational pattern for SaaS that enables a single instance
of an application to be hosted on the same hardware and accessed
by multiple customers, so-called tenants, with the aim of lowering
costs. Tenants are able to configure the system according to their
particular needs. Objective: This research aims at the obtaining
an overview of the challenges and research opportunities in MTA
context for SaaS through a Systematic Mapping Study. Results:
Eighty nine primary studies were selected for discussions on
advances and opportunities for further investigations. The results
showed the relevancy of MTA and pointed out the main research
trends for next years in this topic.
