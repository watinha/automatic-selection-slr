The Framework for Testing of Web Services through Actions in Addition to Scripts
As Web Services draw modules within and across enterprises, dynamically and belligerently testing Web Services has become crucial. Comprehensive Functional, Concert, Interoperability and Susceptibility Testing form the Pillars of Web Services Testing. Only by adopting a comprehensive testing department, enterprises can safeguard that their Web Services is robust, scalable, interoperable, and secure. Overall functionality of web services would be informal towards test. But, only if we methodically trust the applications components (services) before we combine them to complete the application. In current scenario web service technology comprehends various testing apparatuses for manipulating and generating the test cases. But these tools and approaches were negotiating security and execution time and consume more resources. The existing methodologies will generate test cases for the low end web services and limited number of requests, due to these constraints we built new testing framework. In this paper we introduced the new basis with testing of actions, scripts and link for web services by the use of test cases. For this approach we used SOAP web services with SOA. The test case generation and testing reports will gives the accurate testing results and test cases. These test cases are generated using Java JUnit testing tool. We implemented our approach in a java based platform for efficient and secure manner.
