Toward the use of Petri nets for the formalization of OWL-S choreographies
Abstract
In this paper, we present a Petri net-based approach for modeling the choreography of semantic Web services which are described following the OWL-S specification. In our approach, each control construct of the OWL-S choreography is represented through a Petri net pattern that captures formally its operational semantics. The main difference between our work and the main proposals that model the semantics of OWL-S services choreography is that, although both approaches represent the service choreography with Petri nets, our proposal is also concerned with the practical execution of the Petri nets by the client. Therefore we also represent the flow of data, the outputs transformations, the effects in the environment, in addition to the structures that control the choreography of the services in our Petri net models. The implementation of the OWL-S choreography is performed in a Petri net ontology-based engine. This is another difference with traditional approaches that only use Petri nets for the analysis of the service properties. Furthermore, the use of an underlying ontology engine for supporting both the domain models of OWL-S services and the Petri net models provides several advantages in terms of reasoning, extension, and reuse.
