A comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art web service composition testing approaches
More and more Web based systems are being developed by composing other single or even composite services. This is due to the fact that not all available services are able to satisfy the needs of a user. The process of composing Web services involves discovering the appropriate services, selecting the best services, combining those services together, and finally executing them. Although much research efforts have been dedicated to the discovery, selection, and composition of services, the process of testing the Web service composition has not been given the same attention. This paper discusses the importance of Web services composition testing, provides a classification of the most prominent approaches in that area, presents several criteria for comparison of those approaches, and conducts a comparative evaluation of the approaches. The results of the paper give an essential perspective to do research work on Web services composition testing.
