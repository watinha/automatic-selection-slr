Special issue: selected papers from the 12th International Symposium on Web Systems Evolution (WSE 2010)
The International Symposium on Web Systems Evolution (WSE) is regarded as one of the premier conferences by the software evolution and maintenance community in its domain. As a symposium, an important focus of WSE is to enable stimulating discussions and interactions of researchers, ranging from the software maintenance and evolution community to the Web engineering and service-oriented computing community, from both academia and industry, while also providing a platform for presenting high-quality research papers. To give a visual impression of the topics covered by WSE from 2001 to 2011, Figure?1 shows a tag cloud constructed from the 170 paper titles published in the corresponding proceedings.
