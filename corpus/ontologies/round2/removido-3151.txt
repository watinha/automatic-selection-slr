Implementation of Real Time Messaging Server using Duplex Web Services
ABSTRACT
This architecture supports two-way client-server interactions.
The Proxy Framework acts as a service broker between the
clients and the CSTA Web services. It dynamically selects the
Web service based on client profile, Web service registry and
runtime service status. The Proxy framework separates service
independent functions, such as session management, event
subscriptions, and type conversion, from the service
dependent logic, such as message composition and parsing, so
that different services can be plugged into the framework
easily. The Proxy Framework can be dynamically configured
into a Client Proxy to facilitate development of CSTA
applications in programming languages, including Visual
C++, Visual Basic and Java. Due to the duplex web services
interaction created, load will be reduced at the server end, at
the same time push back service which is a part of the twoway
interaction of the web service will pass the message to
other client in the network. Emphasis will be on increasing the
data transfer speed, at the same time use of a web service in a
chat server will make it work better and faster in distributed
environment.
