An Ontology-based Automated Test Oracle Comparator for Testing Web Applications
Traditional test oracles have two problems. Firstly, several test oracles are needed for a single software   program to perform different functions and maintaining a large number of test oracles is tedious and   might be prone to errors. Secondly, testers usually test only the important criteria of a web application,   since its time consuming to check with all the possible criteria.     Ontologies have been used in a wide variety of domains and they have also been used in software   testing. However, they have not been used for test oracle automation. The main idea of this thesis is to   define a procedure for how ontology-based test oracle automation can be achieved for testing web   applications and minimize the problems of traditional test oracles. The proposed procedure consists of   the following steps: first, the expected results are stored in ontology A by running previous working   version of the web application; second, the actual results are stored in ontology B by running the web   application under test at runtime; and finally, the results of both ontology A and B are compared. This   results in an automated test oracle comparator. Evaluation includes how the proposed procedure   minimizes the traditional test oracle problems and by identifying the benefits of the defined procedure.
