Multi-agent Based Information Collaboration Computation
Abstract:
This paper proposes the information collaboration computation based on multi-agent. The process structure of information collaboration computation is discussed. Based on the process structure, the multi-agent information collaboration task process is analyzed according to the task life cycle. The multi-agent based information collaboration computation framework includes task modeling, task management, and multi agent implementation is proposed and analyzed. The prototype system has been applied in information collaboration computation and proven effectively.
