Data consistency and rollback for cloud analytics
An extract-transform-load (ETL) platform fetches consistent datasets in a batch for a given period of time and provides the ability to rollback that batch. The batch may be fetched for an interval of time, and the ETL platform may fetch new or changed data from different cloud/on-premise applications. It will store this data in the cloud or on-premise to build data history. As the ETL platform fetches new data, the system will not overwrite existing data, but rather will create new versions so that change history is preserved. For any reason, if businesses would like to rollback data, they could rollback to any previous batch.
