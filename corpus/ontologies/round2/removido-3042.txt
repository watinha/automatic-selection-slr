Cloud computing adoption decision modelling for SMEs: a conjoint analysis
Abstract
Cloud computing is an emerging technology that promises competitive advantages, cost savings, enhanced business processes and services, and various other benefits to enterprises. Despite the rapid technological advancement, the adoption of cloud computing is still growing slowly among small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs). This paper presents a model to support the decisionmaking process, using a multi-criteria decision method PAPRIKA for the socio-technical aspects influencing SMEs cloud adoption decision. Due to the multifaceted nature of the cloud computing adoption process, the evaluation of various cloud services and deployment models have become a major challenge. This paper presents a systematic approach to evaluating cloud computing services and deployment models. Subsequently, we have conducted conjoint analysis activities with five SMEs decision makers as part of the distribution process of this decision modelling based on predetermined criteria. With the help of the proposed model, cloud services and deployment models can be ranked and selected.
