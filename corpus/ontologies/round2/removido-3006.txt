Towards Supporting International Standard-Based Software Engineering Approaches Using Semantic Web Technologies: A Systematic Literature Review
Abstract  Motivated by the assumption that Semantic Web technologies are not sufficiently leveraged in the Software Engineering discipline (SE) to provide support regarding the standardization of software development processes by means of international software standards, we investigate the existence of systematic literature reviews in this regard. We concluded that none of the available reviews is specifically focused on analysing international standard-based SE approaches, but on investigating SE approaches in a general way. In this paper, we present the details about all the stages in the conducting of a systematic literature review on the Semantic Web technologies-based support for the standardization of the SE discipline regarding software development processes; one of the major findings of the presented review is that nowadays there is a shortage of approaches providing support for the standardization of software development processes for small and very small software companies.
