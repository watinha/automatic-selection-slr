Distributed agent-based performance testing framework on Web Services
Abstract:
Web Services are applied widely in the field of information technology, and performance testing for Web Services applications has become an important problem. This paper introduces the method of performance testing, and proposes a framework of agent-based performance testing on Web Services, which includes TestFlow Generator, Scenario Creator, Test Manager, Load Generation Agent and Test Analyzer. And the implementation of kernel modules in the framework is introduced especially. To realize the load allocation to distributed Load Generation Agents from Test Manager, a queue-based allocation strategy is given.
