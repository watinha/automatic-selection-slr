The Research on Web Service based Network Management
Abstract This paper proposes Web Service based network  management. The Web Service based network management  system is analyzed. It consists of network management layer,  collaborative management implementation layer, and  management function layer mainly. The complex  management network tasks can be accomplished  respectively by more than one Web Service distributed on  Internet and the Web Services interchange information  based on XML message. The SNMP/XML gateway and the  translation between GDMO/ASN.1 and XML/Schema are  designed and implemented to implement the integration  between the legacy network management systems and the  network management developed by Web Service  technologies. The service management in Web Service based  network management is discussed. Service composition/recomposition  in Web Service based network management is  analyzed based on the QoS requirements negotiation  between the network management requirements and the  statement of Web Service and network, OWL-S being used  to described the network management requirements to  discover the suitable Web Service, BPEL being used to  describe the Web Service composition
