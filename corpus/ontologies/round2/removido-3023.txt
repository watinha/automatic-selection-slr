A Survey of Software Testing in the Cloud
Abstract:  Cloud computing has emerged as a new computing paradigm that impacts several different research fields, including software testing. Testing cloud applications has its own peculiarities that demand for novel testing methods and tools. On the other hand, cloud computing also facilitates and provides opportunities for the development of more effective and scalable software testing techniques. This paper reports on a systematic survey of published results attained by the synergy of these two research fields. We provide an overview regarding main contributions, trends, gaps, opportunities, challenges and possible research directions. We provide a review of software testing over the cloud literature and categorize the body of work in the field.
