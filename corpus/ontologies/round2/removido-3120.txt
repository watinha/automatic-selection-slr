FINITE SAFETY MODELS FOR HIGH-ASSURANCE SYSTEMS
Preventing bad things from happening to engineered systems, demands improvements  to how we model their operation with regard to safety. Safety-critical and  fiscally-critical systems both demand automated and exhaustive verification, which  is only possible if the models of these systems, along with the number of scenarios  spawned from these models, are tractably finite. To this end, this dissertation addresses  problems of a model's tractability and usefulness. It addresses the state space  minimization problem by initially considering tradeoffs between state space size and  level of detail or fidelity. It then considers the problem of human interpretation in  model capture from system artifacts, by seeking to automate model capture. It introduces  human control over level of detail and hence state space size during model  capture. Rendering that model in a manner that can guide human decision making  is also addressed, as is an automated assessment of system timeliness. Finally, it addresses  state compression and abstraction using logical fault models like fault trees,  which enable exhaustive verification of larger systems by subsequent use of transition  fault models like Petri nets, timed automata, and process algebraic expressions. To  illustrate these ideas, this dissertation considers two very different applications - web  service compositions and submerged ocean machinery.
