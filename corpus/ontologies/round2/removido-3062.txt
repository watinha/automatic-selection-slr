Test Data Generation Based on GUI: A Systematic Mapping
Abstract For the general case, the complete automation
of test data generation is an undecidable problem,
and many researches employ meta-heuristics trying
to find a reasonable partial solution. System testing
performed via graphical user interface (GUI) imposes
extra challenge for automation due to hundreds and
often thousands of possibilities of events that can be
generated. Objective: This work presents a study based
on systematic mapping aiming at identifying the state of
the art and the state of the practice on the automation
of system testing carried out via GUI. Method: We employed
the traditional protocol of mapping study to support
the data collection. Results: The work was carried
out from 6th February 2012 to 1st May 2013 resulting in
the selection of 39 out of 598 primary studies obtained
with the application of the search strings. Some of
these works used, besides functional testing criteria,
structural testing criteria to guide meta-heuristics. In
relation to meta-heuristics, the distribution of work
was more uniform, with a slight majority using Genetic
Algorithms for test data generation. Conclusion: There
are few research groups working on this subject. One
particular author is responsible for authoring more
than 30% of the selected primary studies and can be
considered a reference in the generation of test data
from GUI. Some research problems identified are 1) the
difficult to represent all the possible GUI interactions
without cause state explosion; 2) the need to evaluate
the techniques on large software products; and 3) the
complexity to automate the representation of the GUI
interactions by reducing the number of infeasible sequences
of actions.
