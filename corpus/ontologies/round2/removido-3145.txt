Architecture of Real Time Messaging server using duplex web services
Abstract:
In this paper architecture of real time messaging server is proposed to support two-way client-server interactions. Here, the duplex web service acts as a service broker between the clients and the server. It selects dynamically the Web service based on the client profile, Web service registry and runtime service status. The Real Time Messaging Framework will dynamically configure into a Client Proxy to maintain communication, which can be real time text, audio or video. Due to the duplex web services, overhead will be reduced at the server side, at the same time push back service, which is a part of the two-way interaction of the web service, will pass the message to other client in the network. In the whole process, emphasis will be on increasing the data transfer speed and efficiency. Thus, use of a web service in a chat server will make it work better and faster in distributed environment.
