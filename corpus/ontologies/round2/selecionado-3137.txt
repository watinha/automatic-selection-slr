Ontology-Based Testing Platform for Reusing
Abstract:  With more and more attention on the software quality, the test case reuse has become a focus in current research. By integrating knowledge management and software reuse theory, several design guidelines for reusable test cases are identified according to the characteristics of software components. A reusable test case knowledge management model is proposed to support the knowledge reuse based on the ontology representation of reusable test cases in this paper. With the ontology and knowledge management model, test engineers can retrieve and reuse test cases flexibly.
