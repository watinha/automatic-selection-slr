Toward Model Checking Web Services over the Web
Abstract
Due to their high level of abstraction, web services blur the traditional distinction between model and code. Conse-quently, executable artifacts can now be written to a level of abstraction that more closely approximates that of mod-els used for model checking. Unlike traditional localized white-box software artifacts, the distributed black-box na-ture of web services demand exhaustive verification. Re-cent usage trends for model checkers coupled with the rise of web services, suggest a different approach to this com-putationally intensive form of verification. This paper out-lines these trends and describes a web-enabled approach to verification of web services. We outline how activities as-sociated with model checking may be migrated into a web services framework, enabling practitioners to more easily incorporate model checking into their solutions.
