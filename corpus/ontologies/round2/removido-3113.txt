A Framework for Time Consistency Verification for Web Processes Based on Annotated OWL-S
Abstract:  The paper presents a timing constraint modeling and analyzing method for Web processes based on annotated OWL-S. The method allows us to find whether Web processes are schedulable and which processes in Web processes are not schedulable without actual execution based on its specification. This also suggests replacement of corresponding components or relaxing timing constraints. The contributions of the paper mainly include two aspects: 1) The paper presents a method for extending OWL-S model based on annotation layers. By using annotation layers, the OWL-S model is extended with auxiliary information such as time constraints. This method can be extended to verify other properties of the Web processes by using different annotation layers. 2) The paper describes how to model Web services based systems and determine whether the specification satisfies time consistency. First, we model a Web process in extended OWL-S with timing constraints. Then, we transform the system specification along with its imposed timing constraints into a TPPN (time predicate Petri net) model. Final, TPPN analyzer can automatically simulate and analyze to verify whether the system specification is schedulable under the imposed timing constraints.
