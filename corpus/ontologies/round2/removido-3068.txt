Semantic Interoperability-Enabled Architecture for Connected Health Services
Abstract
With the increasing availability of connected health organisations, key medical information is expected to be accessible at the point of care. However, the high sensitivity of the clinical data and the large heterogeneity in health information systems pose a great interoperability challenge, including solutions that rely solely on the use of data exchange standards. Due to low adoption of these standards, such solutions will not sufficiently scale to achieve this objective. This chapter presents a service-based approach that utilises domain models combined with extensible problem models, enriched with domain terminology and knowledge services to enable autonomous data governance and semantic interoperability. The chapter addresses the resulting requirements, describes the proposed a solution and reports the results from the prototype of the approach.
