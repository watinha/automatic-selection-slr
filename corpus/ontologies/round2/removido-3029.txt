SAAS network-based backup system
A system fetches consistent datasets in batches for a given period of time and provides the ability to retrieve each batch. Batches of data may be fetched for an interval of time. The present system may fetch new or changed data from different cloud/on-premise applications. It will store this data in the cloud or on-premise to build data history. As the system fetches new data, existing batches of data will not be overwritten. New batches of data are created as new versions so that change history is preserved. Past batches of data for a past time period may be provided to one or more tenants.
