Automatic SaaS test cases generation based on SOA in the cloud service
Abstract:  Cloud Computing is a popular solution that has been used in recent years to cooperate and collaborate among distributed applications over networks. Effective testing to ensure cloud service quality becomes a key for the cloud computing adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework that generates test cases for cloud services based on SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture). This approach uses source code comments to create WSDL-Ss (Web Service Semantics) and upload these WSDL-Ss to third parties, e.g. UDDI (Universal Description Discovery and Integration). In the third parties, the WSDL-Ss are translated to ESGs (Event Sequence Graphs) to model the cloud services. Finally, test cases are created from the ESGs to verify the cloud services' accuracy. A prototype system with a cloud banking is provided to illustrate this framework.
