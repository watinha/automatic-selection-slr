Maintaining Motivation Models (in BMM) in the Context of a (WSDL-S) Service Landscape
Abstract  The ever-changing business context requires organisations to constantly adapt their motivation and service representations. While there has been work focusing on the relation between the motivation- and service level, very little work has been done in providing machinery for handling (propagating) changes at the motivation level and identifying the resulting impact on the service landscape. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which addresses this problem.
