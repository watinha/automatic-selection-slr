An insight into campus network user behaviour analysis decision system
Abstract  Through research tools such as data warehouse and data mining in combination with abundant data peculiar to network users, this paper provides an insight into campus network user behaviour analysis and decision systems. Furthermore, the authors attempt to base webpage classification criteria on the open directory project (ODP) with a view to exploring specific patterns and rules found in network user behaviours. On the basis of those pioneering studies, the authors have put forward some ideas, procedures, and a framework concerning behaviour analysis and decision systems
