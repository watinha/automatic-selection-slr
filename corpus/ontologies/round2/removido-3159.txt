Automated Test Oracles: State of the Art, Taxonomies and Trends
Test oracle methods have changed significantly over time, which has resulted in
clear shifts in the research literature. Over the years, the testing techniques, strategies,
and criteria utilized by researchers went through technical developments due to the
improvement of technologies and programming languages. Software testing designers,
known as testers, currently have several resources to increase their confidence in the
software under test correctness. All of these Software Testing resources are supposed
to include a mechanism to decide whether a particular execution is considered a failure
or not. In Software Testing environments, this decision is the responsibility of the test
oracle. Despite the evolution and adaptation of testing techniques over more than
30 years, test oracles remain a particular and relevant issue. In this chapter, using
literary evidence from a pool of about 300 studies directly related to test oracles, we
present a classification of test oracles based on a taxonomy that considers their source
of information and notations. Based on this classification, we perform a quantitative
analysis to highlight the shifts in (evolution of) research on test oracles. Exploring
geographical and quantitative information, we analyzed the maturity of this field using
co-authorship networks among studies published between 1978 and 2013. Further, we
determine the most prolific authors and their countries, main conferences and journals,
supporting tools, academic efforts, and use a comparative analysis between academia and
industry. Finally, from these analyzes we draw an analytic reflection about contemporary
test oracle approaches and a criticism about oracle trends.
