Ontology Combined Structural and Operational Semantics for Resource-Oriented Service Composition
Abstract: Resource-oriented Services recently become an enabling technology to integrate and  configure information from different heterogeneous systems so as to meet ever-changing  environment which not only need the concepts for entities but also require the semantics for  operations. By the aim of combining structural and operational semantics agilely, a Semantic  Resource Service Model (SRSM) is proposed. Firstly, SRSM describes Entity-Oriented and  Transition-Oriented Resource by semantic meta-model which contains data structures and  operation semantics. Secondly, by describing structural semantics for Entity-Oriented  Resource, heterogonous inputs/outputs of a service can be automatically matched. Thirdly, by  describing operational semantics for Transition-Oriented Resource, the service composition  sequence can be inferred after ontology reasoning. Then, both Entity-Oriented and TransitionOriented  Resources are encapsulated into composited RESTful service. At last, a case study  and several comparisons are applied in a prototype system. The result shows that the proposed  approach provides a flexible way for resource-oriented service composition.
