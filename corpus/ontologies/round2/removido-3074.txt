Exploration of take-off ontology of model airplane and its application
Abstract  Research in this paper is to construct domain ontology called take-off ontology, based on which an application is developed to enable the user to retrieve model airplane and watch its take-off. Take-off ontology is constructed based on DOLCE+DnS, the famous upper ontology. Using DOLCE knowledge on model airplanes is constructed and using DnS and its extension, knowledge on situations (situation ontology) and related interpretations (description ontology) of take-off is constructed. The format that is used to represent take-off ontology is topic maps (XTM format) that can be easily processed by tm4j, the Java-based package. The application handles user-defined sequences of operations, which are constructed with glossary of DOLCE+DnS and contain varying operations on the user-selected model airplane during its take-off. After handling sequences of operations the application generates a scene reflecting (includes visually) behaviours of the model airplane during its take-off.
