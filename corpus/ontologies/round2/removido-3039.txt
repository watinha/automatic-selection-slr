ASSESSMENT CRITERIA OF IAAS SOLUTION IN CLOUD COMPUTING
Most companies have adopted cloud solutions to deploy their application services for earning more profits or  reducing operating costs. Unfortunately, most buyers of cloud solutions have no ideas how to make the best decision  for purchasing a cloud solution. The intention of this paper is to propose some assessed criteria from the IaaS point  of view. We then translate the suggested criteria to practical issues from the functions and the performance points of  view. Finally, we compare the satisfactions and the performance of VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V and CitrixXen in  the issues. All buyers of cloud solutions can refer to our results.
