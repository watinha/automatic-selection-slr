Testing Discovered Web Services Automatically
The reliability of web services is important for both users and software developers. In order to guarantee the
reliability of the web services that are invoked and integrated at runtime, mechanisms for automatic testing
of web services are needed. A basic issue in web service testing is to be able to generate appropriate input
values for web services and to estimate whether the output obtained is proper for the functionality. In this
work, we propose a method for automatic web service testing that uses semantics dependency-based and data
mutation-based techniques to generate different test cases and to analyze web services. We check whether the
services function properly under the input values generated and enriched from various data sources and we
check robustness of web services by generating random and erronous data inputs. Experimental evaluation
with real web services show that proposed mechanisms provide promising results for automatic testing of web
services.
