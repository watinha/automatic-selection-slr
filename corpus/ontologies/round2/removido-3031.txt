HLA-Based SaaS-Oriented Simulation Frameworks
Abstract:  SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) as a part of cloud computing is a new approach for software construction, evolution, and delivery. This paper proposes HLA-based SaaS-oriented simulation frameworks where simulation services will be organized into a SaaS framework running in a cloud environment. This SaaS-oriented frameworks can be applied to multiple application domains but illustrated by using HLA (High-Level Architecture). The framework will allow integration of a variety of modules, service-oriented design, flexible customization, multi-granularity simulation, high-performance computing, and system security. It has the potential to reduce system development time, and allows simulation to be run in a cloud environment taking advantages of resources offered by the cloud.
