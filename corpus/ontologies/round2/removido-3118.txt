Modeling and Model-based Testing of Service Choreographies
The testing of service-based applications is an important but challenging activity. Especially the integration testing is a difficult task that needs to cope with the message-based communication in the service-oriented world. In this thesis, a model-based approach to service integration and integration testing is proposed. The necessary research work to realize its phases is the main contribution of the dissertation. First, MCM, a domain-specific language for service choreography modeling, is introduced together with a precise semantics that makes it suitable for integration testing. Then, a framework for generating service integration tests is presented, incorporating three different model-based test generation techniques that can be chosen according to the test context. Further, it is explained how the generated test cases are transformed into concrete test scripts, thus enabling their execution on an enterprise service-based application. Finally, the conducted case study of the MCM-based approach in an industrial setting is described.
