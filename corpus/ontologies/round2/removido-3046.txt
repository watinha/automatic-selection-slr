The EMFIS Model Enable More Frequent Integration of Software
Abstract:
The EMFIS model allows companies to explicate a representation of the organization's current situation regarding continuous integration impediments, and visualizes what the organization must focus on in order to enable more frequent integration of software. The model is used to perform an assessment of twelve factors, where the ratings from participants representing the developers are summarized separately from ratings from participants representing the enablers (responsible for processes, development tools, test environments etc.). The EMFIS model is based on semi-structured interviews with 20 developers from two companies which develop large-scale software systems, and a literature review that included 74 research papers and four books. The model has been validated in workshops and interviews, which in total included 28 individuals in five different companies. The model was well received during the validation, and was appreciated for its simplicity and its ability to show differences in rating between developers and enablers.
