A Systematic Survey on Automated Test Case Generation from UML Sequence Diagram Using GA and Other Approaches
Software testing is the pre-eminent part of the software development life cycle process.
Generating test cases is one of the challenging parts in software testing. Test cases are a set of
conditions where a tester will test whether the system or an application is working as it is
established to do. Test cases are often referred as test scripts, when they are collected into test
suite. Test automation defines that the system should work based on the established
functionalities that has been described. Genetic Algorithm is an adaptive search optimization
technique which performs implicitly parallel search in a large solution space and manipulates
simulation. The nature of GA is to perform testing of all competitive behavior of the solution
space until a good behavior is evolved. This paper presents a survey on automated test case
generation from UML sequence diagrams using GA (Genetic Algorithm) and other techniques.
