Verifying and Enhancing the Correctness of the Dynamic Composite Web Service

Organizational workflows are now automated by incorporating the dynamic composite web services. As more and more web service is evolving now, enforcing the Quality of service (QoS) factors in web service is in need today. Among the various QoS factor, reliability play a vital role. Reliability is defined by using the functional and non functional metrics. Functional metrics are correctness, fault tolerance and testability of the web service. Non functional metrics are timeliness and Interoperability. In this paper, a model is proposed to verify and enhance the correctness of the web service in the composite web service environment.
