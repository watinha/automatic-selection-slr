A Systematic Mapping Study of Empirical Studies on Software Cloud Testing Methods
Abstract:
Context: Software has become more complicated, dynamic, and asynchronous than ever, making testing more challenging. With the increasing interest in the development of cloud computing, and increasing demand for cloud-based services, it has become essential to systematically review the research in the area of software testing in the context of cloud environments. Objective: The purpose of this systematic mapping study is to provide an overview of the empirical research in the area of software cloud-based testing, in order to build a classification scheme. We investigate functional and non-functional testing methods, the application of these methods, and the purpose of testing using these methods. Method: We searched for electronically available papers in order to find relevant literature and to extract and analyze data about the methods used. Result: We identified 69 primary studies reported in 75 research papers published in academic journals, conferences, and edited books. Conclusion: We found that only a minority of the studies combine rigorous statistical analysis with quantitative results. The majority of the considered studies present early results, using a single experiment to evaluate their proposed solution.
