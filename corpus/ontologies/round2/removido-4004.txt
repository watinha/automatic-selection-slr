Cloud manufacturing service composition modeling and formal verification based on Calculus for Orchestration of Web Service
Abstract:
To solve the problem of modeling and formally verifying the composition of cloud manufacturing services, a new modeling and formal verification approach based on Calculus for Orchestration of Web Service (COWS) combined with Unified Modeling Language (UML) was proposed. First UML activity diagram for Cloud Manufacturing service composition was built with MagicDraw software, and saved as an XML file. The XML file was translated into a COWS file via UML4SOA, and formally verified with COWS Model Checking program (CMC). Furthermore, a composite service about part processing was given. Activity diagram of the service composition was built, including milling service, drilling service, exception handling, event handling and compensation mechanism. Finally, the composition verification result showed that the proposed approach was feasible.
