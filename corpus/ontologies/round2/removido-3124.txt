Modeling method of ontology web service interaction based on Coloured Petri Net
Abstract:  Formal verification of Web service composition is an important means for ensuring the quality of Web service. The Web service composition modeling is a key step of the validation of Web services interaction. Based on the semantic consistency of the Web services description semantic OWL-S and Coloured Petri net, this dissertation proposes a modeling method of Web services interaction based on the OWL-S and Coloured Petri Net and the description rules of OWL-S service operation semantics by CPN. And the analysis and verification of this modeling method has also been done.
