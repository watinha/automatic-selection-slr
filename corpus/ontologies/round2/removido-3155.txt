Simulation product fidelity: A qualitative & quantitative system engineering approach
In using Modeling and Simulation for the system Verification & Validation activities, often the  difficulty is finding and implementing consistent abstractions to model the system being simulated  with respect to the simulation requirements. A proposition for the unified design and  implementation of modeling abstractions consistent with the simulation objectives based on the  computer science, control and system engineering concepts is presented. It addresses two  fundamental problems of fidelity in simulation, namely, for a given system specification and some  properties of interest, how to extract modeling abstractions to define a simulation product  architecture and how far does the behaviour of the simulation model represents the system  specification. A general notion of this simulation fidelity, both architectural and behavioural, in  system verification and validation is explained in the established notions of the experimental frame  and discussed in the context of modeling abstractions and inclusion relations. A semi-formal  ontology based domain model approach to build and define the simulation product architecture is  proposed with a real industrial scale study. A formal approach based on game theoretic quantitative  system refinement notions is proposed for different class of system and simulation models with a  prototype tool development and case studies. Challenges in research and implementation of this  formal and semi-formal fidelity framework especially in an industrial context are discussed.
