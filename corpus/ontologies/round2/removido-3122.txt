Using Workflow Patterns to Model and Validate Service Requirements
Abstract:
Service requirements documentation plays a crucial role on the quality of service-oriented systems to be developed. A large amount of service requirements are documented in the form of natural language, which are usually human-centric and therefore error-prone and inaccurate. In order to improve the quality of service requirements documents, we propose a service requirements modeling and validation method using workflow patterns. First, it extracts the process information using natural language processing tools. Then it formalizes the process information with a requirements modeling language - Workflow-Patterns-based Process Language (WPPL). Finally, the defects existed in service requirements are checked against a set of checking rules by matching with workflow patterns. A financial service example - Trade Order - was used to illustrate our approach
