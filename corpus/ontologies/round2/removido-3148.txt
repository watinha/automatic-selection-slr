Grid Analysis Environment Service Architecture for Structured Modeling
Abstract:
Structured Modeling is a common modeling method. Modeling analysis in Structured Modeling is complex, difficult and time-consuming. This paper proposed the service architecture under Grid analysis environment for SM that is ideally suited to Semantic Web applications. Based on WSDL, OWL-S, FIPA, and OGSA, extending existing Grid paradigms to harness emerging Web service technologies such as SOAP, WSDL and BPEL, a concise overview of Grid middleware for SM is provided. The functionality model, the Web service-based grid architecture for SM, and the logic function architecture of SM is proposed by this paper.
