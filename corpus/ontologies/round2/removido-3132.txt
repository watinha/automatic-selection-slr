Towards a Reference Architecture for Software Testing Tools
Producing high quality software systems has been one of  the most important software development concerns. Software  testing is recognized as a fundamental activity for assuring  software quality; however, it is an expensive, errorprone,  and time consuming activity. For this reason, a diversity  of testing tools has been developed, however, they  have been almost always designed without an adequate attention  to their evolution, maintenance, and reuse. In this  paper, we propose an aspect-based software architecture,  named RefTEST (Reference Architecture for Software Testing  Tools), that comprises the knowledge to develop testing  tools. This architecture is strongly based on separation of  concerns and aspects, aiming at evolving, maintaining and  reusing efforts to develop these tools. Our experimental results  have pointed out that RefTEST can contribute to the  development and reengineering of testing tools.
