Web Service Discovery Based on User Requirements
Abstract:
With the rapid development of Web services, Web service discovery becomes a significant challenge in the matching precision and efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel method in the view of users' requirements for Web Service discovery. We set up the requirement model firstly, so as to present users' requirements in details, then cluster the Web Services due to users' common requirements, and obtain corresponding Web services' QoS values. Thus, users can find their really needed Web services in an ordered list. The case study indicates the effect of our method, namely, in the view of users' requirements, we sort the candidate Services due to their functions and their QoS attributes in descending order.
