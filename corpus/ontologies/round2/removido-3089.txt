A Real Options Approach to Testing
Abstract
Complex systems such as autonomous robots and networks of unmanned vehicles are being
developed to perform sophisticated tasks and collaborative missions in uncertain operational
environments. These systems may involve significant levels of autonomous behavior, may rely
on network centric operations, or may constitute a system of systems (SoS) under the control
of multiple independent stakeholders. Testing such complex systems presents unique
challenges compared to traditional systems, especially given emergent behaviors and
uncertainties surrounding anticipated missions and operations. In this paper, we discuss these
challenges and their impact on a spectrum of test decisions, including test design, planning,
execution, and long term strategy. We then show how real options methods can be applied to
support decision making under uncertainty for testing complex systems.
