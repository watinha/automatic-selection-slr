ACI (automated Continuous Integration) using Jenkins: Key for successful embedded Software development
Abstract:
Continuous Integration (CI) is the most common practice among software developers where they integrate their work into a baseline frequently. The industry is facing huge challenges while developing Software (S/W)s at multiple sites and tested on multiple platforms. The best way to make CI faster and more efficient is to automate the build and testing process. Jenkins is a CI tool that helps in automating the complete process, reducing the work of a developer and check the development at each and every step of S/W evolution. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of Jenkins for software patch integration and release to client. We consider a real-life scenario, how the software development is carried out in corporate ventures and how Jenkins can save developers/integrators crucial work hours by automating the complete process. In this paper, Jenkins is implemented in a master/slave architecture where master node is the Jenkins server and slaves are the Jenkins clients. We discuss the usage of various plug-ins available that allow Jenkins to be used with any environment of software development.
