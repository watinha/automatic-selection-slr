Relacionando Conceitos de Areas de Estudo de Desempenho da Ciencia da Computacao
Abstract. There are several areas of computer science whose main point of
study is the performance of computer systems, whether for the construction of
software with performance as to estimate the performance of systems. Examples
of such areas are: Performance Evaluation, Software Performance Engineering,
Software Performance Testing and Experimental Studies. However, there is no
work in the literature that unifies or even lists the concepts and methodologies
they raised. In this context, this paper describes how these areas can be related,
and this study will provide the basis for the definition of an ontology.
