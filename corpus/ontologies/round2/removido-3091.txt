The Development of an Architecture Framework for Systems Engineering Process Simulators
Abstract

Systems engineering process simulators can help users to explore risks and evaluate the consequences of various project, process, and organization decisions. These types of simulators can incorporate the complex system dynamics associated with various concerns and include critical factors, their associated relationships, and corresponding effects, allowing one to reason and explore various decision options. Simulators can also help educate current and new engineers to understand the multi-faceted issues related to systems engineering projects and processes. In support of the development of these types of simulators, this paper discusses the need for an architecture framework for systems engineering simulators. An architecture framework is proposed as an enabler to assist in the development of systems engineering process simulators.
