GENERATING TEST CASES OF COMPOSITE SERVICES BASED ON OWL-S AND EH-CPN
In web service times, the techniques for composing services are based on service reuse and automatic integration. A new web service will be generated by composing some existing web services. These web services cooperate with each other to provide a new more complex function. It is necessary and very important to test the interaction behavior between any two web services during composition. In this paper, a kind of enhanced hierarchical color petri-net (or EH-CPN) is introduced to generate test cases for testing the interaction, where EH-CPN is transformed from OWL-S document, and both control flow and data flow information in EH-CPN are analyzed and used to generate an executable test sequence, and further test cases are created by combining the test sequence and test data in an XML file.
