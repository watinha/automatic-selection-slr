EEMTI: An extending framework for nested web service verification
Abstract:
Presently, the web services are commonly used in web program development. These service agents may contain a nested call to other agents in order to complete their tasks. Therefore, the processing time of these agents may consume the processing time according to the external process of others. Moreover, there might be some errors within the external web agents. Therefore, the web service flows must be determined before real implementation. As a consequence of such requirement, the Web Services Composition (WSC) must be clearly define the flows and web descriptions to support the verification process of the web services agents. In this paper a new architecture, modified from the existing EMTI, is proposed using the extending framework, EEMTI, with extending Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) of the nested schema. Every element in the required agents is completely monitored. Consequently, the hidden false can be unclosed and corrected before the agent is called.
