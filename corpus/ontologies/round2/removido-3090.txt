Assessing autonomy vulnerabilities in military vehicles
Abstract  The Autonomous Ground Resupply (AGR) Program is a U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) effort to reduce the number of soldiers required for ground resupply. One objective of this program involves providing vehicles with the capability to operate unmanned in a variety of circumstances. Prior to fielding, this system is undergoing an assessment to identify possible vulnerabilities. We use this system to illustrate a general approach to the assessment of the autonomous decision making, describing a process which could be used to identify vulnerabilities in the autonomy of military systems without describing any actual vulnerabilities discovered in the AGR system.
