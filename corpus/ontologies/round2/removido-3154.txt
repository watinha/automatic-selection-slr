Research Questions for Validation and Verification in the Context of Model-Based Engineering
Abstract : In model-based engineering (MBE), the abstraction power of models is used to deal with the ever increasing complexity of modern software systems. As models play a central role in MBE-based development processes, for the adoption of MBE in practical projects it becomes indispensable to introduce rigorous methods for ensuring the correctness of the models. Consequently, much effort has been spent on developing and applying validation and verification (V&V) techniques for models. However, there are still many open challenges. In this paper, we shortly review the status quo of V&V techniques in MBE and derive a catalogue of open questions whose answers would contribute to successfully putting MBE into practice.
