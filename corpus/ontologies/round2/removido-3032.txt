Service-orientation in computing curriculum
Abstract:  Web software development and cloud computing based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) represent the modern software engineering theories, practices, and technologies. As an architecture-driven computing paradigm, SOA and SOC are mature and are becoming the major paradigm for software development. SOA and SOC should be taught in all computer science and computer engineering programs. We do not suggest using SOC to replace the currently taught Object-Oriented Computing (OOC) paradigm. As SOC is based on OOC, we suggest to teaching SOC as the continuation and extension of OOC. At Arizona State University, SOA and SOC paradigm is incorporated into our Computing Science and Software Engineering programs since 2006. This paper presents the topics of the related courses and the open resources created for the courses, which are available for public accesses, including textbooks, lecture presentation slides, tests and assignments, software tools, a repository of sample services and applications, and tutorials of using tools and the cloud computing environment for service hosting and deployment.
