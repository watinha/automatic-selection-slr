Metadata manager for analytics system
A metadata management system receives metadata changes and automatically updates a metadata architecture which maps the data. The metadata changes may be received through a simple user interface by a user or administrator. Once received, the system may automatically update schemas and data transformation code to process data according to the new data mapping preference. The system may handle metadata updates in a multi-tenant system having one or more applications per tenant, and may update data for a single tenant and 1 or more tenant applications in a multitenancy.
