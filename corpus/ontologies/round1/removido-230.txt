Towards optimization of Software Engineering ontologies
Abstract:  This paper presents detail analysis of generic and specific Software Engineering ontologies. The analysis results can be used as a road map for the optimization of existing or developing new ontologies. For this purpose, state of the art ontologies have been selected and analyzed in terms of their domain covered, scalability, use of Software Engineering standards, scope and application. Salient features and limitations of these ontologies are presented in this paper which can be considered by ontology engineers and research community for enhancing the knowledge in the field of Software Engineering and specifically Knowledge-based Software developing processes. Based on the presented analysis, we have developed a generic Software Engineering ontology and tried to address such issues which are previously neglected.
