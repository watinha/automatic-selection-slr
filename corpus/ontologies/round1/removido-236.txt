An Ontology for Controlled Experiments on Software Engineering
Running multiples experiments in Software Engineering  introduces the need of recording data as well as transferring  knowledge across them, specially considering that several  researchers are involved on replicating experiments. In this  work we explore ontologies to support knowledge transfer,  helping to elucidate the associated concepts of controlled  experiments and their relationships. Based on our expertise  on conducting controlled experiments, we have proposed an  ontology to experimental studies, named EXPEROntology.  The ontology proposed is intended to be used as a tool  for knowledge transfer, assisting researchers, reviewers,  and meta-analysts in designing, conducting, and evaluating  controlled experiments. In order to validate our ontology  we have instantiated it in to a controlled experiment.
