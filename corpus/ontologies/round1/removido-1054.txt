3D Virtual Client Center and its Service Oriented Modeling
Abstract:  Client centers have considerable influence to the success of a business. Companies encourage people to visit their client centers, in the hope of engaging potential clients. However, this could give rise to large financial costs. With the recent advances in the technology of computer graphics and virtual reality, this paper presents an approach to construct 3D virtual client centers. To visit a virtual client center, the client no longer needs to travel from place to place, but just takes a virtual tour while staying before an internet-enabled computer. The contributions of this paper are as following: 1) we present an approach to construct a 3D virtual client center in a relatively convenient way, 2) we model the virtual client center as a collection of services, to further facilitate the development work.
