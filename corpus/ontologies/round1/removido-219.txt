A General Framework for Testing Web-Based Applications
Software testing is a difficult task for web based applications due to their special features like multi-tier structure and emergence of new technologies (e.g. Ajax). In recent years, automatic testing of web based applications has been emerged as a promising technique to tackle the difficulties of testing these types of applications and several frameworks have been proposed for this purpose. But the most important problem of these frameworks is the lack of generality for different types of tests and programming environments. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for automatic testing of web based applications, that covers all aspects of different types of testing in an arbitrary web based application.
