Towards the establishment of supporting mechanisms for modeling and generating educational content
Content modeling plays a fundamental role in the development of educational modules, helping the author to determine the main concepts to be taught and providing a systematic way to structure the relevant parts of the knowledge domain. Despite its relevance, there are few approaches for modeling educational content. In this perspective, an integrated approach for content modeling, named IMA--CID, was proposed. IMA--CID is composed of a set of models, each one considering specific aspects of the development of educational content; however, applying it without an automated support can be an error-prone activity. Motivated by this scenario, in this paper we describe IMATool -- a supporting tool for content modeling, particularly designed for helping the open and distributed construction of the EMAIL@IMA--CID models. Mechanisms for content generation are also available. We illustrate our ideas by applying IMA--CID and IMATool in the development of an educational module for the software testing domain. The preliminary results obtained provide evidences on the practical use of such mechanisms for modeling and generating content.
