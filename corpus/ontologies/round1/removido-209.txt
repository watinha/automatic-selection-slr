Visual management of workflows in web development frameworks
Abstract:  Web development frameworks (WDFs) that incorporate both Workflow paradigms and the Model View Controller (MVC) are known as WMVC-WFDs. Such frameworks guide the developer in generating the flow of control between the various components. Despite the pressing need for a visual environment to help developers manage the overwhelming number workflows during development, we have not come across any work that addresses this legitimate concern. In this work we describe, in the context of Ruby on Rail (ROR), an abstract model for the visual generation and management of workflows in WMVC-based web application.
