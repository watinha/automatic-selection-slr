An Ontology-based Software Test Generation Framework
In automated test generation, granting control to test experts over test selection can enhance quality of generated test suites. However, in many cases test experts control is limited and they can not define custom coverage criteria. This work proposes a general framework for application of knowledge engineering to software testing, which facilitates specification of custom coverage criteria and provides means for generating test cases from different artifacts in dissimilar domains.
