A multi-agent system apporach for user-session-based testing of web applications
Web applications are becoming increasingly complex and yet important for companies. As web applications become more and more prevalent, their testing and quality assurance become more and more important and crucial. Due to the complexity of the underlying technologies of web applications, testing of such softwares is challenging.    Applying user sessions data as test cases can reduce the cost of regression testing process. In this paper we provide a multi agent software environment in order to support automatic replay of user sessions. In this environment different agents can perform replay of user sessions by being distributed on various platforms and geographic locations.
