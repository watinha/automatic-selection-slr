Use of Learning Strategies of SWEBOK Guide Proposed Knowledge Areas
This paper gives a general vision of the knowledge areas that compound the software engineering according to the IEEE SWEBOK (Software Engineering body of knowledge) guide, and starting at that point proposed a pedagogic strategy, to be applied as a cathedra complement at the Pedagogic and Technologic University of Colombia (UPTC), due the knowledge areas proposed at SWEBOK provide an appropriate structure that adapts itself to the teaching-learning process at the Systems and Computation engineering college. The strategy that square up the educational objectives of Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive domain is designed and later evaluated by an advisor and further applied to an study group belonging to the Software Engineering study line; taking the results as a base to define the viability of this propose to be extended to another knowledge areas proffered by SWEBOK guide.
