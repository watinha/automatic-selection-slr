Estendendo rest-unit : geracao baseada em U2TP de drivers e dados de teste para RESTful Web Services
RESTful Web services are a solution that has been widely used for Web 2.0 development and API publication because of the simple and easy understanding interface, allied to high productivity framework support. RESTful Web services, as all software systems, must be tested to achieve an acceptable quality level so that can be used with trust by other systems. This test discipline should be integrated with development, since the beginning of the project and applied throughout the software development cycle. At the graduation work of Filipe Borges (2009), a solution was proposed (REST-Unit) to automatically generate test drivers from models specified using U2TP (UML 2.0 Test Profile) pattern, to validate RESTful Web services behavior. In this project, based in REST-Unit, REST-Unit+ was developed, which goal is to extend test drivers automatic generation, proposing a solution to relate them with their test data, creating data pools and data partitions. Through this process, the generated tests become more complete and their execution is facilitated, because the accepted data types are already specified and documented. REST-Unit+ is a solution for generating test drivers and test data from an U2TP model. The model, when exported to XMI, allows the test code to be generated. A prototype was implemented to validate the algorithm, and it was applied throughout an example that demonstrates the complete usage of this solution. This prototype can generate a RESTful Web service test driver and test data from a model. The time spent on test case specification is compensated by the time saved with test code generation. Besides, it has as an advantage, the well documented UML test case model, and test data models (data pools, data partitions and instances) used in these test cases, and the bigger quality that is achieved working at a higher abstraction level.
