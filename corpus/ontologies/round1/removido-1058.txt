Open Problems in Software Test Coverage
Abstract Software testing is concerned with the production and maintenance of high quality systems. Test coverage is one major component in software testing. It gives a meaningful description of how much testing is required. The level of test coverage is an indicator of testing thoroughness, which in turn helps testers decide when to stop testing. Several studies addressed coverage criteria effectiveness and adequacy. However, there are several interesting open problems. We identify nine open problems in test coverage and discuss what issues need to be addressed. The objective of this paper is to direct the attention of researchers and testers toward the areas that need to be investigated.
