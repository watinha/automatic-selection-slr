ValiPar Service: Structural Testing of Concurrent Programs as a Web Service Composition
The testing of concurrent programs is essential to ensure the quality of such programs. One of the main challenges of such testing activity is to provide tools that enable it at a reasonable operational cost. The service orientation paradigm provides guidelines for the development of tools as services, addressing such requirement. The division of the structural testing of concurrent programs into services faces fundamental challenges. The objective of this paper is to provide structural testing of concurrent programs as a Web service composition. We divided this monolithic structure by defining the concepts, relations and parameters of the structural testing of concurrent programs to support this activity using a service composition. Our main contributions are in the definition of Web services for the structural testing of concurrent software, focusing on the service contracts and capabilities. The developed services present flexible contracts and capabilities that can be reused in different contexts.
