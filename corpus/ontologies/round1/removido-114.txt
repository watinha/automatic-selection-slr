Uso da tecnica de teste estrutural para o teste e monitoracao de servicos
Software oriented computing aims at developing software by the composition of services. It promotes software reuse and the implementation of dynamic, flexible and low coupling applications. Services provide specific business functionalities and are provided as a black-box. The use of services is only possible if the developers of service applications (integrators) trust the third party services. Particularly, testing is one of the solutions to obtain confidence on third party software. However, testers can only use specification based testing techiniques due to unavailability of the source code. In this context, testers cannot use the benefits of combining specification and implementation-based testing techniques. This works aims at proposing an an approach to introduce the structural testing technique in the context of service-based applications, but without revealing the source code. The proposed approach promotes the development of testable services, which are services with high testability and exposes operations through a testing interface to support structural testing. Integrators can test testable services and get, without having access to the source code, a coverage analysis on structural criteria. Test metadata are also provided along with testable services to help integrators on creating more test cases to increase the coverage obtained. The proposed approach is also used to support monitoring activities. The approach is generic and an instantiation is presented to create testable services written in Java. Formal experiments and case studies were conduct to validate the proposed approach and the instantiation. The results provide evidences of the applicability and the benefits of the approach for both testing and monitoring activities when compared to only using the functional approach
