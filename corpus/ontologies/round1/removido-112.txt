Estabelecimento de uma arquitetura de referencia orientada a servicos para ferramentas de teste de software
Software testing is considered as an important activity to ensure the quality of software systems. To support such activity, a diversity of testing tools have been developed. However, most of them have been separately built and have usually their particular structures and architectures, which has hindered the integration and reuse of these tools. In this context, efforts have been employed in order to provide service-oriented testing tools, i.e., tools that are based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture). In another perspective, reference architectures have played an important role in the development of software systems, since they contain information about how to develop systems for a particular application domain, contributing to the success of systems in that domain. Thereby, our main objective is to establish a service-oriented reference architecture, named RefTEST-SOA (Reference Architecture for Software Testing Tools based on SOA), which aggregates the knowledge and experience about how to organize service-oriented testing tools, also aiming at integration, scalability and reuse provided by SOA. To establish this architecture, we have used ProSA-RA, a process that provides guidelines to the design, representation and evaluation of reference architectures. Results achieved by a conducted case study indicate that RefTEST-SOA is a viable and reusable architecture for developing service-oriented testing tools
