API TESTING TOOL IN CLOUD
Testing becomes an important process not only in term of exposure but also in terms of performance, safety, usability. For software quality assurance, software testing is the basic activity. Locating the test environments is too expensive in terms of hardware, software licenses. Testing as service (TaaS) is new model to provide testing capabilities to end user. Users save the cost of complicated maintenance and upgrade effort, and service providers without impact on end users. Due to uneven volumes of concurrent request it is important to address the elasticity of TaaS platform in cloud environment. With the emergence of extreme programming, test-driven development and other agile methods, unit testing has become an important part of almost every development effort. At the same time, many applications provide application programming interfaces (APIs) to allow code-level access to the functionality. These APIs, just like any other interface into the product, must be tested for web services over cloud before they are released to the end-users. We develop a tool of TaaS over cloud, that toolkit shall provide a rich GUI to allow even a novice user to perform API testing with ease.
