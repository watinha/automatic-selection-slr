Using ontology to generate test cases for GUI testing
Abstract  Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing is a knowledge�intensive process. In this paper, ontology is introduced to generate user�centric GUI test cases. First, GUI and non�GUI components are captured by reverse engineering techniques. Next, relations among GUI components are analysed and a GUI ontology is constructed by representing all analysed results. Then, test case generation rules are defined and used to simplify test cases. After that, a case study is demonstrated on a general communication application, which shows that the proposed approach is technically feasible and ontology can facilitate GUI testing by utilising knowledge of GUI systems and experience of testers.
