Barriers to Implement Test Process in Small-Sized Companies
Abstract: Producing high-quality software has been one of the greatest challenges of the development market in the last few years. The software testing is the essence of the quality assurance, but the implementation of this activity is still difficult due to may factors. This paper presents some factors that influence on the adoption of a testing process. Some of these factors were outlined in the literature, and others were selected empirically based on the work experience obtained in a large company. We present the results obtained in the experiments that compare the software testing performance when implemented considering a formal testing process and when carried out in an ad-hoc way.
