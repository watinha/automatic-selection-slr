Algebraic Testing of Web Services: The Monic Approach
Abstract Web services are designed to be discovered and
composed dynamically, which implies that testing must also
be done dynamically. This involves both the generation of test
cases and the checking of test results. This paper presents
algorithms for both of these using the technique of algebraic
specification. It focuses in particular on the problem that web
services, when they are third-party, have poor controllability
and observability, and introduces a solution known as monic
floating checkable test cases. A prototype tool has implemented
the proposed testing technique and it is applied to a case study
with a real industry application GoGrid, demonstrating that
the technique is both applicable and feasible
