A Technique for Testing Composed Web Services including Footprint
Abstract - Testing a service based application with more
suitable approach is introduced in this paper. Paper has an
architecture that responds to changes of service operation ,
service composition changes and allow all Footprints by Tree.
Our test system is able to identify changes that occur in service
operations and operational arguments in a service description
of a test candidate. Automated reconfiguration is used to
support the continuous operation of the testing systems during
a test candidate change. Our proof-of-concept test system
performs runtime testing on our model atomic and composite
web services using a random testing technique with previous
footprints records
