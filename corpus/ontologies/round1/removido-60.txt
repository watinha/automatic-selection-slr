OntoArch Reliability-Aware Software Architecture Design and Experience
Abstract: Reliability-aware software architecture design has recently been gaining growing attention among software architects. This chapter tackles the issue by proposing an ontology-based, reliability-aware software architecture design and evaluation approach, called OntoArch, which incorporates quantitative reliability evaluation in software architecture design by the means of the OntoArch ontology and the OntoArch tool. The OntoArch approach is characterized by: (1) integration of software reliability engineering and software architecture design; (2) proposing a reliability-aware software architecture design process model; (3) developing the OntoArch ontology in the context of software architecture design and software reliability engineering; and (4) the OntoArch tool not only enabling software architects to design architectures and model reliabilities, but also functioning as a knowledge management platform relying on reliability-aware software architecture design. The OntoArch approach is validated for a software architecture design; for example, Personal Information Repository (PIR), with the use cases of OntoArch-based software architecture knowledge management, software reliability profiling, and software architecture modeling and evaluation.
