Use and Design of Ontology-based Multi-agent System for Multi-site Software Development Environment
Large software development projects involve several participants who are distributed
geographically without face-to-face communication. To maintain collaborative work
through effective communication and coordination, it is necessary to have a common
understanding of terminology and methodology to clarify software engineering
concepts and enable knowledge exchange and reuse. We consider an ontology
designed for distributed software development can be a solution to improve
information and knowledge sharing in such scenarios. However, software team
members may not be familiar with the use of the ontology by themselves, an active
support is needed to proactively deliver knowledge and project information that is
semantically defined in the ontology based on appropriate context. In this paper, we
propose an ontology-based multi-agent system conceptual framework that can provide
intelligent assistance to access and recommend knowledge and project information
during multi-site software development. We use UML 2.1 to model interaction among
software agents. This framework is expected to improve the effectiveness of the
communication and coordination of software teams to reduce the unsuccessful rate of
the software development project.
