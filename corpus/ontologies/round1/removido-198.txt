SRAD: a semantic rapid method for software development
Using the Semantic Web (SW) technologies in Software Engineering (SE) is one way of overcoming current SE problems. In this article, we have proposed a semantic method for rapid software development, namely SRAD. From the SRAD point of view, static and dynamic models of software are described in domain ontology and application ontology, respectively. The domain ontology can be a strong substitute for data model and the application ontology contains formal description and implementation of the software functionalities. We have also proposed a method for implementing the software functionalities in the application ontology by using the SW technologies. To execute the software functionalities, any Java compatible rule engine can be used, but for efficiency reasons, we have developed a Running Engine (RE) that supports all types of SWRL atoms. By using the SRAD method, opposed to the current development methods that try to generate code from models, we can produce a formal runnable model of software which encompasses both business logic and program control logic.
