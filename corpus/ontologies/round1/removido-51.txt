IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION SYSTEM
Accurate development time estimation is crucial for project management in general, and critical for software intensive systems projects, in particular. Before beginning the project, little information is available for development details. Therefore, development time may not be estimated correctly. If data on previous projects in the same domain is available, this can be used for development time estimations. At the beginning of the project, requirements are defined and requirements specification document is created as a formal document in the  v organizations. By using the reused requirements from previous projects, a similarity analysis can be performed and this analysis can be used for development time estimation. This study investigates the applicability of a model that was proposed earlier for project management in general, in software intensive systems development projects. In this scope, the impact of requirements reuse on product development duration for different products in a similar domain is studied. Similarity analysis has been performed for different products in the same domain and the result of this analysis is used to estimate the development time. For development time estimation, Griffins model [9] is used. For the applicability of Griffins model for industrial companies, nine case studies from different organizations have been performed for software and system development projects which consist of hardware and software components. The results of the case studies are compared with Griffins model. According to the empirical results, a modification to Griffins formulation for product development time is proposed for software projects. For the projects which include only software or both software and hardware, the proposed model will guide project managers to estimate project budgets more accurately.
