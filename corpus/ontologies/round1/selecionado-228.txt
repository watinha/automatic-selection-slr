Ontology driven semantic annotation based GUI testing
Abstract:
One major agreed upon factor responsible for popularity of software systems, is graphical user interface. Besides the efforts and desires of development organizations, testing a graphical user interface thoroughly, is still almost a nightmare. Manual effort required to complete this task is very large. One major breakthrough to automate this manual effort of GUI testing is to map GUI events with some models and graphs. Event-flow graph is relatively a fresh and useful addition to cope up with automation of GUI testing. In this paper we are presenting an idea of using ontology for GUI testing. This ontology is supposed to work on the basis of semantics of possible events and then annotations will be used to generate the test cases and work as an oracle for verification of the output of testing effort. This work still is based on theoretical concepts and needs practical verification, which will be completed in short time.
