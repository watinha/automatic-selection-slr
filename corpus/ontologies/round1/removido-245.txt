IMA-Tool: A tool for modeling and automatic generation of educational content
Abstract:
In this paper we discuss the establishment and application of IMA Tool - a web-based tool for the modeling and automatic generation of educational content. The tool is based on IMA-CID - an approach for modeling educational content, capable of addressing conceptual, instructional and didactic issues altogether, in an integrated way. IMA-CID and IMA Tool have been applied in the development of an educational module for software testing. The preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of such mechanisms for modeling and generating content.
