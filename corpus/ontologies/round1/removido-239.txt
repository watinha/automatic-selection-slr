A Contribution to Modeling and Automatic Generation of Educational Content
Abstract. The development of educational modules concise units of study,
composed by theoretical and practical content which can be delivered to learners
by using technological resources has been extensively explored in the
context of Teaching and Learning. In this paper we present and discuss supporting
mechanisms for developing educational modules, emphasizing aspects
of modeling and generating content. We present AIM?CID an integrated
approach for modeling educational content which considers different didactic
perspectives. We also propose a collaborative tool that supports modeling and
generating content based on the AIM?CID.
