Employing Privacy-Preserving Techniques to Protect Control-Flow Graphs in a Decentralized, End-to-End Regression Test Selection Framework for Web Services
Abstract:  In an end-to-end, regression testing framework employing a safe regression test selection (RTS) technique that uses control-flow graphs (CFGs) to model Web service interactions, service providers must share their CFGs to participate. However, CFGs are sensitive implementation details and service providers are unwilling to expose them especially across autonomous systems. In order to encourage participation in the proposed framework, several privacy-preserving techniques are employed designed to protect the sensitive information contained within CFGs while still maintaining the overall effectiveness of the approach. The privacy-preserving techniques protect the information contained within CFGs by sanitizing individual nodes and altering the shape of the CFG. A case study will be presented to help illuminate the framework and provide a measure of the overall effectiveness of the approach.
