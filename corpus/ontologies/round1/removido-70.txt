Testing Web Services: A Survey
The Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm is allowing computer systems to interact with each other in new
ways. According to the literature, SOC allows composition of distributed applications free from their platform and thus
reduces the cost of such compositions and makes them easier and faster to develop. Currently web services are the most
widely accepted service technology due to the level of autonomy and platform-independency they provide. However,
web services also bring challenges. For example, testing web services at the client side is not as straightforward as
testing traditional software due to the complex nature of web services and the absence of source code. This paper
surveys the previous work undertaken on web service testing, showing the strengths and weaknesses of current web
service testing strategies and identifying issues for future work.
