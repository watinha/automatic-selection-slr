Efficient Agent Based Testing Framework for Web Applications
Abstract- Now days, making use of web based applications becomes crucial for the success of businesses worldwide. But as they are open and
built on Internet, this kind of applications is imposing the new challenges to the developers and researchers such as such as dynamic behaviors,
heterogeneous representations, novel control flow and data flow mechanisms, etc. In the previous studies, the agent based approach provided for
web application testing in order to reduce the complexity of such applications. A four-level data flow test approach can be employed to perform
structure testing on them. In this approach, data flow analysis will be performed as Function Level Testing, Function Cluster Level Testing, Object
Level Testing, and Web Application Level Testing, from low abstract level to high abstract level. But that approach was limited because only the
basic features of such framew ork are implemented.
Therefore, in this research thesis we are further extending that framew ork w ith more specific features implement like specific test agents for each
particular type of Web document or object. Moreover, integrating more testing approaches, such as navigation testing, object state testing,
statistical testing, etc., is still necessary for a systematic testing approach for Web applications
