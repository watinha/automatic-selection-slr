Ontology Learning from Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Abstract: Learning ontologies from software requirements specifications with individuals and relations between individuals to represent detailed information, such as input, condition and expected result of a requirement, is a difficult task. System specification ontologies (SSOs) can be developed from software requirement specifications to represent requirements and can be used to automate some time-consuming activities in software development processes. However, manually developing SSOs to represent requirements and domain knowledge of a software system is a time-consuming and a challenging task. The focus of this PhD is how to create ontologies semi-automatically from SRS. We will develop a framework that can be a possible solution to create semi-automatically ontologies from SRS. The developed framework will mainly be evaluated by using the constructed ontologies in the software testing process and automating a part of it. i.e. test case generation.
