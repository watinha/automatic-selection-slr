Utilizing Fuzzy colored Petri-Nets to monitor cardiac pacemaker behavior  Sign In or Purchase
Abstract:  Connected health devices are used to in vivo cure and prevent abnormal conditions without manual intervention. This paper presents an intelligent agent-based method for runtime verification of cardiac pacemaker runtime behavior. Construct the agent's knowledge base based on the Fuzzy Colored Petri Net (FCPN). Based on our previous experiences, the FCPN will be reduced the scale of our network in comparison to the Petri-net(PN). Compared to a simple inference engine, the FCPN can cover the concurrent states and in addition intelligent agent can ensure the accuracy of the runtime verification operation of the cardiac pacemaker in vital and unexpected situation.
