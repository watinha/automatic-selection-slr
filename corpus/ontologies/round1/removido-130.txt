Estudo e Definicao de uma Metodologia de Teste de Software no Contexto de Sistemas Embarcados Criticos
Computing is becoming increasingly critical in the embedded applications space and depending on the software, its malfunction may result in a severe financial loss to the loss of human life. Considering this scenario, we presented a systematic literature review in order to investigate the evolution of work-related activity test critical embedded software in order to evaluate the level of compliance found in the work to the standard DO- 178B (Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification). This research, in addition to conducting a systematic review of publications about this issue, has resulted in the composition of primary studies to define a process of quality testing and including the requirements of DO-178B at their different levels of criticality.
