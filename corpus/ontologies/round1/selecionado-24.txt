Automated testing of Web Services system based on OWL-S
Abstract:  As Web Services becomes mature and popular, they are always integrated together, forming systems to carry out coherent tasks. The distributed application of Web Services involves many standard protocols and various runtime behaviors and thus makes the systems' automated testing more difficult. In this paper we propose a series of applicable automated testing methods for Web Services system. First, deduce abstract test cases from interaction requirement properties of Web Services system. Second, specify test cases according to SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) properties and abstract test cases. Finally, generate mutants under AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) technology support, drive them by specific test cases using improved Fit (Framework for Integrated Test), and then kill mutants based on business logic. Experiments have shown that our algorithms meet the applied demands and perform well as an automated testing tool for Web Services system.
