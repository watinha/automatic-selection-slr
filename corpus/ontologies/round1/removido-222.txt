A verification framework for Service-Oriented Architecture applications
Oracle and Sun Microsystems are adopting this new approach to developing software and
systems. SOA advocates run-time system integration of loosely coupled services across
heterogeneous platforms in a distributed environment and also improves the flexibility of
system development. However, trustworthiness becomes a serious problem and
appropriate tradeoffs have to be made.
This research introduces a verification framework for SOA. An effective verification
framework will greatly reduce the effort for rapid and adaptive service composition and
evaluation of applications based on SOA. The proposed framework consists of two
aspects: a testing infrastructure for static verification of services, and a policy-based
dynamic verification mechanism for service collaboration and composition. The proposed
verification framework provides the following advantages:
It offers a CV&V mechanism to verify services.
It provides the function of integration testing and functional (black-box) testing.
It provides the capability of test case profiling, test case ranking, service ranking,
static service profiling, and dynamic service profiling.
It has the capability of dynamic verification over services.
WebStrar (Web Services Testing, Ranking, and test case Ranking) is the component in
the verification framework to perform static verification. It assures the trustworthiness
and reduces the vulnerability of WS by rigorous positive and negative testing, reliability
assessing, and ranking. A policy specification language PSML-P (Process Specification
and Modeling Language for Policy) and a policy enforcement framework "Pi4SOA"
(Policy Infrastructure for Service-Oriented Architecture) are proposed to verify and
control the collaboration process of SOA during service runtime.
