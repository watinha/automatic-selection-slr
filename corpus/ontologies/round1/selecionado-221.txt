COWST: Collaborative Web Service Tester
Software testing is done to check the quality of the product or service under test. Test techniques include the process of executing a  program or application and finding software bugs (errors or other defects). Software testers face great challenge in testing Web Services  (WS) especially when integrating to services owned by other vendors. They must deal with the diversity of implementation techniques used  by the other services. However, testers are in lack of software artifacts, the means of control over test executions and observation on the  internal behavior of the other services. An automated testing technique must be developed to be capable of testing nonintrusively and no  disruptively. Addressing these problems, this paper proposes a collaborative testing tool called COWST in which test tasks are completed  through the collaboration of various test services that are registered, discovered, and invoked at runtime using the ontology of software  testing. The ontology can be extended and updated so that it can support a wide open range of test activities, methods, techniques, and  types of software artifacts. Experimental evaluation of the framework has also demonstrated using a Travel Agency Service.
