Development of a Multi-Agent Framework for Software Quality
Software test tools has been growing increasingly in terms of popularity. These testing tools are used by developers according to the their development platforms. Selection of a software test tool is a fundamental step for software testing. This paper presents a multi-agent framework facilitating the software test tool selection process. The framework has been designed for the Windows platform using the .NET architecture. The main design goals are to develop an effective and exible framework that enables a user to select different types of web-based testing tools. Also a UML model has been generated to build a multi-agent system. Thanks to the designed framework, a user is able to decide which tool should be used for detecting database, web-based and static code faults. Testing results of our framework are seen in Table 2. According to the obtained results, software test procedures can be instantly and efficiently managed based on multi-agent systems.
