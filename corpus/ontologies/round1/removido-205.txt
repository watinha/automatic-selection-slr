An Agent-Based Framework for Automated Testing of Web-Based Systems
- Parallel to the considerable growth in applications of web-based systems, there are increasing demands for methods and tools to assure their quality. Testing these systems, due to their inherent complexities and special characteristics, is complex, time-consuming and challenging. In this paper a novel multi-agent framework for automated testing of web-based systems is presented. The main design goals have been to develop an effective and flexible framework that supports different types of tests and utilize different sources of information about the system under test to automate the test process. A prototype of the proposed framework has been implemented and is used to perform some experiments. The results are promising and prove the overall design of the framework.
