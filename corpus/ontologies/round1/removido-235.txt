Using Ontologies for Modeling Educational Content
Content modeling plays a fundamental role in the development process of educational
modules.In spite of its relevance, there are few approaches for modeling
educational content. Motivated by this scenario, in a previous work we proposed
IMA-CID (Integrated Modeling Approach Conceptual, Instructional, Didactic)
an integrated approach for modeling educational content.In this work we discuss
the evolution of IMA-CID by exploring the use of ontologies at its conceptual level.
The goal is to provide a better comprehension of the knowledge domain to be taught
as well as to ease the knowledge sharing and reuse among authors. We illustrate
our ideas by using an ontology of software testing for developing an educational
module on this domain. The development of a supporting tool to help on the importation
of ontologies and on the automated edition, interpretation and execution of
the IMA-CID models is also discussed.
