Metamorphic Testing for Web Services: Framework and a Case Study
Abstract:
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has become a major application development paradigm. As a basic unit of SOA applications, Web services significantly affect the quality of the applications constructed from them. Since the development and consumption of Web services are completely separated under SOA environment, the consumers are normally provided with limited knowledge of the services and thus have little information about test oracles. The lack of source code and the restricted control of Web services limit the testability of Web services. To address the prominent oracle problem when testing Web services, we propose a metamorphic testing framework for Web services taking into account the unique features of SOA. We conduct a case study where the new metamorphic testing framework is employed to test a Web service that implements the electronic payment. The results of case study show the feasibility of the framework for web services, and also the efficiency of metamorphic testing. The work presented in the paper alleviates the test oracle problem when testing Web services under SOA.
