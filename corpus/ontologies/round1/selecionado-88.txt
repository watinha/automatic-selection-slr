A flow graph-based test model for OWL-S web services
Abstract:  OWL-S is a standard for specifying the ontology of web services. It enables web services to be discovered, invoked, and composed automatically. However, OWSL-S web service is difficult to analyze and test as XML-based OWL-S description is hard to understand. In addition, OWL-S introduces various control constructs to compose multiple services and allows describing the preconditions and expected effects of the services, which further complicates the analysis and testing of web services. This paper proposes a flow graph-based test model for OWL-S web services. In particular, the model abstracts the structural test artifacts of OWL-S web services. It can facilitate testers to understand and analyze the control flow of OWL-S web services. Based on the test model, test paths can be derived to ensure the correctness of OWL-S web services.
