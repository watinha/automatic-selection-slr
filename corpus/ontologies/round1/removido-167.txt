A Systematic Review of Agent-Based Test Case Generation for Regression Testing
There is an urgent need to create awareness about the potential benefits of using agents in software test case generation and to identify the need to develop agent-based regression testing techniques and approaches. It may help in reducing time and cost required for testing. This study reports systematic literature review of existing test case generation approaches for regression testing and agent-based software testing systems. The emphasis is articulated on agent-based regression test case generation. Further research directions are recommended. In the systematic literature review, we framed three sets of research questions. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified 115 potential research papers on test case generation in regression testing and agent-based software testing. We explored journals, international conferences, workshops and identified 59 studies in test case generation for regression testing and 56 studies in agent-based software testing. The data extracted from our study are classified into seven broader areas of agent-based software testing. Based on our systematic literature survey, we recognized available techniques, approaches, platforms as well as methodologies for regression test case generation and developing agent-based software testing systems. This study will benefit the researchers to carry forward their work in the domain of regression test case generation and agent-based software testing. To cut down on schedule and cost, mobile agent-based software testing can be a promising alternative.
