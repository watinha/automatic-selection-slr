Testing-based Behavioral Assessment for Service Selection
Abstract
Building Service-oriented Applications implies the
selection of adequate services to fulfill required
functionality. Even a reduced set of candidate
services involves an overwhelming assessment
effort. In a previous work we have presented an
approach to assist developers in the selection of
Web Services. In this paper we detail its behavioral
assessment procedure, which is based on
compliance testing. This is done by a specific
Behavioral Test Suite for exposing required
messages interchange from/to a client application
and a Web Service. In addition, helpful information
takes shape to build the needed adaptation logic to
safely integrate the selected candidate into a
Service-oriented Application. A concise case study
shows the potential of this approach for both
selection and integration of a service among a set of
candidates.
