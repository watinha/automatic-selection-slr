A Software Tool for Selection and Integrability on Service Oriented Applications
Abstract. Connecting services to rapidly developing service-oriented
applications is a challenging issue. Selection of adequate services implies to
face an overwhelming assessment effort, even with a reduced set of candidate
services. On previous work we have presented an approach for service selection
addressing the assessment of WSDL interfaces and the expected execution
behavior of candidate services. In this paper we present a plugin for the Eclipse
IDE to support the approach and to assist developers daily tasks on exploring
services integrability. Particularly for behavioral compatibility we make use of
two testing frameworks: JUnit and MuClipse to achieve a compliance testing
strategy.
