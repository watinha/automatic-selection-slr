A Systematic Literature Review on Systems-of-Systems Knowledge Representation
Systems-of-Systems (SoS) are a special type of systems composed by other systems.
These systems together can reach goals that they could not benefit when operating on
their own. However, this emerging discipline is not consolidated yet and there is a lack
of standardization in the terminology used. In this context, knowledge representation
approaches can be used to support activities in the SoS field. They can also play an
important role in formalizing concepts by providing a common understanding among
the community and practitioners. In this technical report we present a Systematic
Literature Review (SLR) conducted to identify how knowledge representation has been
applied to SoS. Our results show that interoperability is the most addressed topic. We
also noticed that there is a lack of formal approaches for establishing communication in
the SoS field.
