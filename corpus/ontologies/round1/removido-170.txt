Web Application Testing Framework using Agents
Testing is a software development activity, devoted to  evaluating quality and improving the end product by  identifying defects and problems. It's an important aspect in  software application development to insure the application  quality which include the application's performance,  reliability, speed, security and functionality. Testing can be  done by automation tools like Win runner, QTP or manually.  Manual testing, is another option, but it takes lot of time and  manpower. Automated testing has increased costs and most of  the times is not affordable for small or middle level  organizations. In this paper we are presenting agent based  testing which can fulfill the testing requirements on smaller  costs. We present an implementation framework of an online  application which can be accessed over the web and on  payment of small amounts can provide different kinds of  software tests for web based applications. The framework  uses Multi Agent Systems to manage, perform, report the  testing procedures.
