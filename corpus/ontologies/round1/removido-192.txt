The Verification and Validation of a Large-Scale System: Equipment TaaS as an Example
Abstract:
This study proposed testing/inspecting as a service (TaaS) for computing equipment and aimed to test objects in the context of combining software and hardware. We developed a dynamic feedback framework to enhance both the efficiency and the quality of the testing service. The framework consists of inner and outer feedback mechanisms, in which the updated industrial standards and client requirements are incorporated allowing the testing to be modified accordingly. A detailed description of the testing procedures and industrial metrology are provided in the study. The improvement gained from TaaS are demonstrated and discussed. The results show that by using infrastructure as a service (IaaS), the physical hardware improves in quality due to the fact that the quality was verified by Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) TaaS or cloud container data center (CDC) TaaS etc. Moreover, the OS in platform as a service (PaaS) can be ensured because the resources of the physical/virtual data in the IaaS were tested by the OS TaaS. As for the application (APP) TaaS, the stability and performance of the OS system can be maintained since the applications of the software on the PaaS have been tested.
