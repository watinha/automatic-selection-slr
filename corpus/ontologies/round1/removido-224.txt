A Framework for the Testability of Service Oriented Architecture
The majority of current researches on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) are focusing on the dynamic services composition design and development techniques, leaving testing task with inefficient outcome and results. Many papers have presented novel testing approaches for supporting testability of SOA systems and Component Based Distributed systems; in which these systems are experiencing many testing challenges under real environments. Many new specifications and standards emerged aiming to define the implementation, trustworthiness, and the Quality of Services (QoS). Furthermore, these standards aid SOA testing in real-time environments. In this paper, we will review prior research works derived from the literature, which aid us to identifying the issues in the testability of SOA systems in real-time. Grounded in this principle, we will highlight the standards, protocols that may apply and aid SOA testing. We will propose an approach to which will make SOA testing on real-time, much relevant and applicable
