Accounting for Product Similarity in Software Project Duration Estimation
We extend an existing model proposed for estimating project duration for industrial projects in general, to software intensive systems projects. We show, through nine di�erent cases studies from di�erent sectors, that product similarity, measured in terms of requirements reuse, can be incorporated into that model to improve its applicability in software intensive systems projects.
