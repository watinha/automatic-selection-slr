A Structural Testing Approach and Tool for Web Service Compositions Based on the WS-BPEL
Web service business process execution language (WS-BPEL) is a most popular programming language which can be used to describe the logic to control and orchestrate multiple Web services participating in a business process. It allows a company to quickly create or adapt new business processes by coordinating different Web services. As other traditional software, the WS-BPEL process needs a lot of testing to ensure its correctness. However, the WS-BPEL processes are complex and difficult to understand. This makes testing Web service compositions a challenging task. Nevertheless, many existing tools for testing WS-BPEL processes are solely based on the functional testing which may not be adequate to ensure the structural correctness. In this thesis, we propose a structural testing approach for Web Service Compositions based on the WS-BPEL. In our approach, we construct two test models based on the defferent aspect of the WS-BPEL process. Using the graphical concept to represent the WS-BPEL process structure and the execution logic based on the aspect of the architecture and the flow respectively which can help user to easily understand the process architecture and the control flow, and then user can edit test case to ensure the correctness of the WS-BPEL process. We also develop a WS-BPEL structural testing tool (WSTT) base on our approach. This tool can construct a WS-BPEL control flow graph and edit test cases for testing the structure of the WS-BPEL process.
