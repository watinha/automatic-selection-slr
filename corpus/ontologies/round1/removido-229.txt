Design and Development of SRIONTO: An Educational Ontology Representing Software Risk Identification Knowledge
Knowledge can be captured and made available to both
machines and humans by an ontology. Ontology can be served
as a structured knowledge representation scheme, capable of
assisting the construction of a personalized learning path. This
paper describes the processes of conceptualization and
specification, or building of, an ontology. The domain for
which the ontology has been constructed is software risk
identification. The required concepts, the semantic description
of the concepts and the interrelationship among the concepts
along with all other ontological components have been
collected from various literatures and experience of the people
from software industry. From which, a taxonomy has been
constructed by using the property isA? and the design
architecture for the required ontology has also been sketched
out manually with nearly four different types of properties. In
order to reduce implementation efforts, the Protege platform, a
scalable and integrated framework for ontological engineering,
has been used to construct the ontology. The constructed
ontology has been represented in owl format, which makes it
more machine understandable. Then the semantic
representation of the knowledge has been made using the OWL
document generator, which automatically generates a set of
documents from the ontology. In order to understand the
knowledge in more detailed way again the ontology has been
visualized using ontoviz tool
