First steps toward a Verification and Validation Ontology
Abstract. This paper presents the key elements of an ontology that  formalizes part of the knowledge about behavioural modeling and the  associated verification and validation technologies. It summarizes the  concepts existing in this area of interest and the relationships among  them. We propose a classification of different modeling formalisms and  a representation of possible verification and validation methods. A system  is represented using several views conforming to different modeling  languages. Its properties can be assessed with verification and validation  technologies. We also describe existing V&V tools and how they are  related to the other elements.
