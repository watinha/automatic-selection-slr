A Survey of Security Assessment Ontologies
A literature survey on ontologies concerning the Security Assessment domain has been carried out to uncover initiatives that aim at formalizing concepts from the Security Assessment field of research. A preliminary analysis and a discussion on the selected works are presented. Our main contribution is an updated literature review, describing key characteristics, results, research issues, and application domains of the papers. We have also detected gaps in the Security Assessment literature that could be the subject of further studies in the field. This work is meant to be useful for security researchers who wish to adopt a formal approach in their methods.
