STUDY OF TESTING AS A SERVICE (TAAS) COST EFFECTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR TAAS IN CLOUD ENVIRONMENT
With application performance catalysing business growth, software testing assumes a very significant role in the growth of an enterprise. Over time, the software testing function has become a challenging activity for enterprises due to increasing technological complexities, software sourcing challenges, rising costs and security issues among others. Typically, software testing is done either internally using the infrastructure that exists within the organization, or then is outsourced to software services providers. At the IT service providers side, software testing underwent a long drawn evolution cycle. From ad-hoc practices within different business units, it gradually evolved to a centralized Managed Test Center approach, and finally towards institutionalising a Testing Center of Excellence (TCoE) within the organisation. This offered customers a dynamically scalable and economical framework which enabled them to outsource their testing requirements and avoid complex contracts, long start-up times, and high levels on investment. The final stage of the evolution cycle of testing has manifested in the form of Testing-as-a-Service (TaaS). Today, Testing-as-a-Service is being increasingly considered a viable testing model by many organizations to achieve reduced costs and improved service for their IT test requirements. To address this importance, We have designed a service offering - Testing as a Service, using Cloud computing. This paper focuses on how organizations can optimize their IT budget through a strategic initiative in the form of On Demand testing
