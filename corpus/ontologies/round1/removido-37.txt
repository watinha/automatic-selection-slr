Web Service Performance Testing
Abstract-Non-functional testing is an  extremely important activity in any Web  service based project. Regardless of the  architectural style being used, nonfunctional  aspects must be fulfilled by a  system. Even if GUI of application is  attractive, user will not visit the  application if it takes more time to load  the pages or crashes when multiple users  access it. In most of the situations, nonfunctional  requirements such as  performance and scalability are validated  using tools. SoapUI can be used in  functional as well as non-functional  testing. Performance, scalability, and  usability are some of the key nonfunctional  attributes expected from any  application. This paper look into the  usage of SoapUI to do performance tests  of web services. In Section II, we discuss  why it is important to consider  performance implications in an SOA. We  proceed with describing performance test  planning of web services. Next, we look at  how SoapUI can be used for various  performance tests with our example.
