A systematic review on the functional testing of semantic web services
Abstract
Semantic web services are gaining more attention as an important element of the emerging semantic web. Therefore, testing semantic web services is becoming a key concern as an essential quality assurance measure. The objective of this systematic literature review is to summarize the current state of the art of functional testing of semantic web services by providing answers to a set of research questions. The review follows a predefined procedure that involves automatically searching 5 well-known digital libraries. After applying the selection criteria to the results, a total of 34 studies were identified as relevant. Required information was extracted from the studies and summarized. Our systematic literature review identified some approaches available for deriving test cases from the specifications of semantic web services. However, many of the approaches are either not validated or the validation done lacks credibility. We believe that a substantial amount of work remains to be done to improve the current state of research in the area of testing semantic web services.
