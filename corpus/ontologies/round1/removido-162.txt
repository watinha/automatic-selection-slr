A Formal Open Framework Based on Agent for Testing Web Applications
Abstract:  This work employs and extends the Gaia methodol- ogy to design a formal open framework based on agent for automatically testing Web applications. In our framework, each test task corresponds to a role and the agent takes this role to achieve its test task or co- operates by interaction with other agent to finish the test tasks. The agent can not only join or leave agent society at will, but also take or release roles at run time dynamically. Our framework can be extended easily by adding new roles to provide much more func- tion. At the same time, agents and roles are loosely coupled; role classes and agent classes can be de- signed at the same time by different teams. The internal design of multi-agent system (MAS) is independent of the Web applications. This framework helps to imple- ment automatically testing of Web applications.
