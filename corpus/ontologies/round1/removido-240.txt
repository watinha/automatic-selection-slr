The 101haskell Chrestomathy: A Whole Bunch of Learnable Lambdas
The paper describes the 101haskell chrestomathy---a collection of Haskell programs implementing features of a hypothetical information system in a manner to represent knowledge about functional programming useful for learning (and teaching). The programs are enriched with documentation, metadata, and links to other knowledge resources such as Wikipedia and Haskell textbooks. The underlying ontology is informed by a process of knowledge integration which derives a consolidated vocabulary mainly by text mining and summarization from textbooks. The usefulness of 101haskell for teaching is demonstrated with a functional programming course that is directly based on 101haskell.
