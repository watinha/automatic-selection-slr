Testing Web Services in the Cloud
Cloud Computing makes it possible for users to access a wide range of web services in the public domain
and to embed these global services in their local applications. This promises to save a significant
amount of individual development cost. The biggest obstacle to using this technology is the problem of
trust. To gain trust in the services offered they have to be extensively tested, either by the user himself
or by a trusted agent. This chapter deals with the testing of web services in the cloud. There are many
similarities to testing web services in a local service-oriented architecture, but there are also significant
differences. In a company specific SOA, testers can gain access to the source. This is not true of the
cloud. There is no possibility of accessing the source. Therefore, testers must rely solely on the specification
contained in the service level agreement SLA and the web service interface definition WSDL
or REST to base their test upon. Testing in the cloud is strictly a black-box test. The goal of a cloud
service test is also not to find errors but to assess the suitability of the service to the purpose of the user.
It may be necessary to test several services in order to find that one best suited to the requirements of the
user. To judge suitability it is necessary to define an ideal usage profile, including performance, security
and other non-functional criteria, and to compare that with the actual profile of each potential service.
For this both static and dynamic analysis methods must be applied. The chapter presents an automated
approach to assessing cloud services and selecting that one most suitable to the user s application.
