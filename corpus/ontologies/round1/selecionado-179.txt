An Ontology-Based Knowledge Sharing Portal for Software Testing
Abstract:  Software testing is a sub area of software engineering which is also a knowledge intensive and collaborative activity. Our previous study results revealed that knowledge in the repositories were outdated, internal documents are unstructured and varied formats, less accessing facilities and lack of targeted delivery methods, such that software testers from software companies are highly affected by not being able to get vital information required to carryout their software testing activities. Ontologies emerge as one of the more appropriate knowledge management tools for supporting knowledge representation, processing, storage and retrieval. A Software testing ontology is designed to represent the necessary software testing knowledge within the software testers' context. The ontology-based Knowledge Sharing Portal is introduced into the semantic representation of software testing knowledge. SPARQL is used as the query language to retrieve software testing knowledge from the semantic storage. Both Ontology experts and non-experts evaluated the developed ontology.
