Estabelecimento de uma arquitetura de referencia para aplicacoes de televisao digital
Embedded systems, especially in consumer electronics, are becoming increasingly complex, requiring the use of new technologies and approaches for their development. In particular, the development of interactive applications for digital TV requires new programming techniques and software engineering practices in order to facilitate the reliability and maintenance of these systems. In a parallel perspective, reference architectures, an special type of software architecture, have been proposed for several applications domain and have effectively contributed to the development, standardization, and evolution of software systems on such domains. However, the use of reference architectures has not been in depth explored in the digital TV domain. In this context, this work proposes a reference architecture for this domain. This architecture enables the development of applications for the procedural middleware environment for the digital TV receiver. The main result achieved in this work is the contribution to the development of interactive TV middleware-based applications, aiming at promoting this area that has been substantially explored in recent years
