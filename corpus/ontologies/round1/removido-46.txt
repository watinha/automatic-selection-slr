A TESTING FRAMEWORK FOR FAULT TOLERANT COMPOSITION OF TRANSACTIONAL WEB SERVICES
Software testers have great challenges in testing of web services therefore testing technique must be developed
for testing of web services. Web service composition is an active research area over last few years. This paper
proposes a framework for testing of fault tolerant composition of web services. It will tolerate faults while
composition of web services. Exception handling and transaction techniques are used as fault handling
mechanisms. After composition web services are deployed on WS-BPEL engine. Testing Framework will fetch
results of composite web service from WS-BPEL engine and check whether composed web service is fault
tolerant and it is in the consistent state.
