Towards Dynamic Random Testing for Web Services
Abstract:
In recent years, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been increasingly adopted to develop applications in the context of Internet. To develop reliable SOA-based applications, an important issue is how to ensure the quality of Web services. In this paper, we propose a dynamic random testing (DRT) technique for Web services which is an improvement of the widely practiced random testing. We examine key issues when adapting DRT to the context of SOA and develop a prototype for such an adaptation. Empirical studies are reported where DRT is used to test two real-life Web services and mutation analysis is employed to measure the effectiveness. The experimental results show that DRT can save up to 24% test cases in terms of detecting the first seeded fault, and up to 21% test cases in terms of detecting all seeded faults, both with the cases of uniformed mutation analysis and distribution-aware mutation analysis, which refer to faults being seeded in an even or clustered way, respectively. The proposed DRT and the prototype provide an effective approach to testing Web Services.
