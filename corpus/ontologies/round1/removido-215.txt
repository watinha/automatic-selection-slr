Practical Experiences of Testing Web Services
Abstract. The utilisation of web services in building e-commerce applications  and business-to-business solutions is becoming increasingly  widespread. The nature of these applications dictates a strong need for  robust and fault-tolerant infrastructures. To this end, the establishment  of sound approaches to testing web services is essential. Existing literature  on the subject typically focuses on theoretical classifications of possible  tests, with limited consideration being given to practical issues. In  this paper we describe the approach taken to testing web services within  the (iterative) development of a large-scale service-based infrastructure.  The system in question is being developed to support a variety of distributed  applications pertaining to healthcare delivery and research. We  also report upon our experiences, which have given rise to a collection of  generic principles for the testing of systems built on web services.
