An Intelligent Broker Approach to Semantics-Based Service Composition
Abstract:  This paper proposes an intelligent broker approach to service composition and collaboration. The broker employs a planner to generate service composition plans according to service usage and workflow knowledge, dynamically searches for services according to the plan, then invokes and coordinates the executions of the selected services at runtime. A prototype called I-Broker has been implemented to support the approach, which can be instantiated by populating the knowledge-base with domain specific knowledge to form domain specific brokers. This paper also reports experiments that evaluate the scalability of the approach
