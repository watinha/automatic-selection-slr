Review of the Present State-of-the-Art of Dynamic Test Reconfiguration of Composite Web Services
Abstract In the wake of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and its applications that integrated services provided by different businesses,  reliability of services play a vital role in the success of those businesses. Testing is the widely accepted approach used to find reliability  of services. Testing web services that are composed to form SOA applications is non-trivial and hard to achieve. Web services with BPEL  workflow drive most of the businesses that affect all stakeholders. Building comprehensive test strategies for cohesiveness of underlying  components and loosely coupled nature of integrated heterogeneous pieces of software is very challenging. Moreover business processes  tend to change that makes the job of testing much more complex. Many researchers contributed towards testing of web services. In this paper  we review the present state-of-the-art of web service composition methods, testing web services, automatic test case generating and  automatic test case reconfiguration. This paper provides insights found in the literature in terms of test methodologies, tools and techniques  used for testing web services and web service compositions.
