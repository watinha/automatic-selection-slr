CREATING A TESTING FRAMEWORK AND WORKFLOW FOR DEVELOPERS NEW TO WEB APPLICATION ENGINEERING
Web applications are quickly replacing standalone applications for everyday tasks.  These web applications need to be tested to ensure proper functionality and reliability.  There have been substantial efforts to create tools that assist with the testing of web  applications, but there is no standard set of tools or a recommended workflow to  ensure speed of development and strength of application.  We have used and outlined the merits of a number of existing testing tools and  brought together the best among them to create what we believe is a fully-featured,  easy to use, testing framework and workflow for web application development.  We then took an existing web application, PolyXpress, and augmented its development  process to include our workflow suggestions in order to incorporate testing at  all levels. PolyXpress is a web application that allows you to create location-based  stories, build eTours, or create restaurant guides. It is the tool that will bring people  to locations in order to entertain, educate, or provide amazing deals.[10] After incorporating  our testing procedures, we immediately detected previously unknown bugs  in the software. In addition, there is now a workflow in place for future developers to  use which will expedite their testing and development.
