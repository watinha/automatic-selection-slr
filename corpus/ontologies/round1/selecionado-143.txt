Towards the Establishment of an Ontology of Software Testing
A growing interest on the establishment of ontologies has
been observed for the most different knowledge domains.
This work presents OntoTest an ontology of software testing,
which has been developed to support acquisition, organization,
reuse and sharing of testing knowledge. OntoTest
has been built with basis on ISO/IEC 12207 standard
and intends to explore the different aspects involved in the
testing activity. Specifically, we are interested in defining a
common well-established vocabulary for testing, which can
be useful to develop supporting tools as well as to increase
the inter-operability among them.
