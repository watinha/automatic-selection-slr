Cost-aware pareto optimal test suite minimisation for service-centric systems
Runtime testing cost caused by service invocations is considered as one of the major limitations in Service-centric System Testing (ScST). Unfortunately, most of the existing work cannot achieve cost reduction at runtime as they perform offline testing. In this paper, we introduce a novel cost-aware pareto optimal test suite minimisation approach for ScST aimed at reducing runtime testing cost. In experimental analysis, the proposed approach achieved reductions between 69% and 98.6% in monetary cost of service invocations while retaining test suite coverage. The results also provided evidence for the effectiveness of the selected algorithm HNSGA-II over the two commonly used algorithms: Greedy and NSGA-II.
