Cloud Testing- Issues, Challenges, Needs and Practice
Abstract- Cloud computing not only changes the way of obtaining computing resources (such as computers, infrastructures, data storage, and application services), but also changes the way of managing and delivering computing services, technologies, and solutions. Cloud computing leads an opportunity in offering testing as a service (TaaS) for SaaS and clouds. Meanwhile, it causes new issues, challenges and needs in software testing, particular in testing clouds and cloud-based applications. This paper provides a comprehensive tutorial on cloud testing and cloud-based application testing. It answers the common questions raised by engineers and managers, and it provides clear concepts, discusses the special objectives, features, requirements, and needs in cloud testing. It offers a clear comparative view between web-based software testing and cloud-based application testing. In addition, it examines the major issues, challenges, and needs in testing cloud-based software applications. Furthermore, it also summarizes and compares different commercial products and solutions supporting cloud testing as services.
