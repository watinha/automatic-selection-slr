Ontology-based Web Service robustness test generation
Abstract:  Web Services are evolving all the time. Web Service testing has received significant attention in both functional and non-functional aspects. Robustness has been considered as a crucial feature of Web Service. How to test whether the service is robust enough under its evolution has become a hard problem. OWL-S (Web Ontology Language for Services) is an ontology-based semantic specification of services I/O and workflows. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate robustness test data based on the ontology specified in OWL-S. Our approach firstly analyzes the OWL-S (and related OWL specifications) to extract the ontology definitions associated with I/O parameters of SUT (Service Under Test). It then derives the semantic constraints on class, property, and parameter dependency from such ontology definitions. At last, it generates robustness test data by applying data mutation operators based on such constraints. We choose a flight ticket selling service in the travel domain as a case study. The preliminary results show that our approach is feasible and effective.
