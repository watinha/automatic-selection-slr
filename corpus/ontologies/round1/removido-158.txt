A Multi-Agent Framework for Testing 3-Tier Distributed Systems Architecture
Lack of time and capital for software testing is an
oft encountered problem in most organizations. The
plethora of possible test cases for each software
component makes software testing a very expensive
and time consuming activity and can, in extreme cases,
account for up to 50% of the total cost of the software
development process. The advent of distributed systems
has augmented the complexity of the testing process
and has made it an even more daunting task than
before. This paper presents an innovative multi-agent
framework to ease some of the burdens associated with
the testing of generic distributed systems. The
architecture of the proposed MAS (Multi-Agent
System) is presented along with detailed descriptions
of the various models arrived at following the analysis
and design phases of the proposed system. The
proposed framework is considered as a step towards
the automation of the testing process for distributed
systems in order to enhance their reliability within an
acceptable range of cost and time.
