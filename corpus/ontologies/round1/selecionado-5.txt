A Top Domain Ontology For Software Testing
In software testing process a large amount of information is required and generated. This information can be stored as knowledge that needs to be managed and maintained using principles of knowledge management. Ontologies can act as a bridge by representing this testing knowledge in an accessible and understandable way. The purpose of this master thesis is to develop a Top domain ontology (TDO) which represents general software testing knowledge. This can be achieved by unifying the domain vocabularies that are used in the software testing. This top domain ontology can be used to link existing software testing ontologies. It can act as an interface between top-level and domain ontologies and guide the development of new software testing ontologies. The standards of ISTQB were used after careful consideration as the main source of knowledge, other sources such as existing software testing ontologies were also used to develop the ontology. The available ontologies for software testing were collected and evaluated against a list of evaluation criteria. The study shows that the available software testing ontologies do not fulfill the purpose for a TDO. In this work, we developed a TDO by using a combination of two ontology development methods: Ontology 101 and Methontology. The resources used for gaining knowledge and reusing the concepts from available ontologies made it possible for this TDO to have a better coverage in the field of software testing. The ontology was evaluated by using two methods: Competency questions and Ontology expertï¿½s evaluation. The evaluation based on competency questions focuses on the structure of the ontology and shows that the ontology is well formed and delivers expected result. The evaluation by ontology experts was done against a set of quality criteria which represented the quality and coverage of ontology. The results shows that the ontology developed can be used as a TDO after fixing some comments from the evaluators. The evaluators agree that the ontology can be adapted to different application of software testing and that it fulfils the main purpose of top domain ontology. The developed ontology could be made better by evaluating and reusing the ontologies that are not published (e.g. STOWS). Ontology maintenance is an ongoing process. Ontology needs to be updated with new knowledge of software testing that emerges with research.
