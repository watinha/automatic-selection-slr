A Quality Assurance Approach and Case Study in BSS
Abstract:  The BSS (Business Support Systems) has played a critical role in strictly competition telecom market. They constantly face stringent challenges such as quality assurance as well as time to market and budget. The test case design is an important step and a higher cost in system quality assurance phase. However by knowledge few test data correlation based approach has some drawbacks such as the coverage limitations and effectives of test case selection. We believe if there is a suitable testing case reusability approaches would have good and enough coverage and lower cost. Therefore, in this paper, we present a quality assurance framework and reusability based approach to design and select test case effectively. On the other hand the study introduces a real world BSS quality assurance works as case study to practice and examine the proposed approach. This article is a continuous work of the BSS transformation project.
