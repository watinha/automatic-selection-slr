A WS-BPEL Based Structural Testing Approach for Web Service Compositions
Abstract:  In recent years WS-BPEL has gain significant attention due to its ability to specify and orchestrate Web services participating in a business process. As the business process becomes complex, the XML-based WS-BPEL document used to describe the interactions among the Web services becomes difficult to understand and test. This paper proposes a structural testing approach for Web service compositions implemented with WS-BPEL. A test model is presented to capture the control flow of the WS-BPEL process. Specifically, the model takes into account the concurrency and synchronization characteristics of WS-BPEL while adapting the BPMN notation to depict the possible process execution flow. Based on the test model, test paths of a WS-BPEL process can be identified and test cases can be derived to validate the compositions of Web services.
