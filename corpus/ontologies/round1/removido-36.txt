Automated Web Service Composition Testing as a Service
Cloud computing brings new business opportunities and services on infrastructure, platform and software level. It provides a new way for testing software applications known as Testing-as-a-Service (TaaS). TaaS eliminates the need of installing and maintaining testing environments on customerï¿½s side and reduces the testing cost on pay-per-use basis. Availability of on-demand testing services allows testers to provide raw cloud resources at run time, when and where needed. This paper addresses TaaS benefits by proposing a TaaS-enabled framework offering cloud-based testing services. The framework, called Testing as a Service Software Architecture (TASSA), supports testing of web service compositions described with Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (WS-BPEL). It consists of two main components: (1) TaaS functionality for fault injection and dependencies isolation of the application under test and (2) Graphical User Interface (GUI) for test case design and execution. TASSA framework could be installed on a local computer or used for building a cloud test lab on a virtual machine. Its feasibility is proved through a case study on a sample business process from wine industry.
