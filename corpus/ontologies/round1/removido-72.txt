A Comprehensive Ontology for Knowledge Representation in the Internet of Things
Abstract:
Semantic modeling for the Internet of Things has become fundamental to resolve the problem of interoperability given the distributed and heterogeneous nature of the "Things". Most of the current research has primarily focused on devices and resources modeling while paid less attention on access and utilisation of the information generated by the things. The idea that things are able to expose standard service interfaces coincides with the service oriented computing and more importantly, represents a scalable means for business services and applications that need context awareness and intelligence to access and consume the physical world information. We present the design of a comprehensive description ontology for knowledge representation in the domain of Internet of Things and discuss how it can be used to support tasks such as service discovery, testing and dynamic composition.
