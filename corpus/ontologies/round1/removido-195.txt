An Ontology for Unmanned and Autonomous Systems of Systems Test and Evaluation
With the advent of unmanned systems and the movement toward greater complexity, the test and evaluation community faces new challenges. This paper presents an ontology for the unmanned and autonomous systems of systems test and evaluation (UASoS T&E) domain that is intended to help support addressing these challenges in T&E. The development of a UASoS T&E ontology provides a means for those interested in the field of UASoS T&E to understand the entities, relationships, and terminology within the domain. The ontology provides a common language and basis of understanding for UASoS T&E that can be leveraged as a foundation for other efforts.
