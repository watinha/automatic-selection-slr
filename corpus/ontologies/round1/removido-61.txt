Uma Arquitetura de Referencia para Medicao de Software
During the execution of software projects, it is necessary to collect, store and analyze data in order to support project and organizational making decisions. Software measurement is a fundamental practice for project management and process improvement. It is present in the main models and standards that address software process improvement, such as ISO/IEC 12207 (ISO/IEC, 2008), CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) (SEI, 2010) and MR-MPS-SW (Reference Model for Process Improvement of Brazilian Software) (SOFTEX, 2012). In models that address software process improvement in levels, such as CMMI and MR-MPS-SW, measurement starts in the initial levels (CMMI level 2 and MR-MPS-SW level F) and evolves as the maturity level increases. In the high maturity, characterized in CMMI levels 4 and 5 and MR-MPS-SW level B and A, measurement includes carrying out statistic process control (SPC). In order to perform the measurement process in an effective way, a computational infrastructure able to support measurement collection, storage and analysis is necessary. In this sense, this work proposes a reference architecture for software measurement that considers both traditional and high maturity measurement. The proposed architecture is platform independent and has been defined based on the Reference Ontology for Software Measurement (BARCELLOS, 2009). It can be used as a basis for defining specific architectures for computational solutions that support the software measurement process. As a proof of concept, the reference architecture was used as a basis for a specific architecture and a tool. In addition, aiming at evaluating the reference architecture proposed, an experimental study was carried out and some preliminary results were obtained
