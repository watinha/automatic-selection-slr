Reference Architectures
This chapter first discusses the definitions given to reference architectures; Then, It clarifies the differences between the reference architecture and reference model, as well as between the reference architecture and product line architecture (i.e. the architecture of software product line). Following this, It presents a model that describes the set of elements that could be found in reference architectures. The chapter presents a process for aiming at systematizing reference architecture engineering. The process, named ProSA-RA2PLA, is an iterative process that systematizes the steps to build product line architectures using the knowledge and elements contained in the reference architectures. Various perspectives of applying these architectures are also discussed. The chapter ends with examples of these architectures and future perspectives for them.
