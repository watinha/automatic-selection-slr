TEST CASE GENERATION AND PRIORITIZATION FOR COMPOSITE WEB SERVICE BASED ON OWL-S
Abstract: Web services are the basic building blocks for the business which is different  from web applications. Testing of web services is difficult and increases the  cost due to the unavailability of source coder. In previous work, web services were  tested based on the syntactic structure using Web Service Description Language  (WSDL) for atomic web services. This paper proposes an automated testing framework  for composite web services based semantics, where the domain knowledge of  the web services is described by protege tool [13] and the behavior of the entire  business operation flow for the composite web service is provided by Ontology Web  Language for services (OWL-S)[6]. Prioritization of test cases is performed based  on various coverage criteria for composite web services. Series of experiments were  conducted to assess the effects of prioritization on the coverage values and benefits  of prioritization techniques were found.
