An Approach for Service Composition and Testing for Cloud Computing
Abstract:  As cloud services proliferate, it becomes difficult to facilitate service composition and testing in clouds. In traditional service-oriented computing, service composition and testing are carried out independently. This paper proposes a new approach to manage services on the cloud so that it can facilitate service composition and testing. The paper uses service implementation selection to facilitate service composition similar to Google's Guice and Spring tools, and apply the group testing technique to identify the oracle, and use the established oracle to perform continuous testing for new services or compositions. The paper extends the existing concept of template based service composition and focus on testing the same workflow of service composition. In addition, all these testing processes can be executed in parallel, and the paper illustrates how to apply service-level MapReduce technique to accelerate the testing process.
