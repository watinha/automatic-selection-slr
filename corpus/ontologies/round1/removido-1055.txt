An Agent-Based Framework  f or Automated Testing of Web-Based Systems
ABSTRACT  Parallel to the considerable growth in applications of web-based systems, there are increasing demands for methods and tools to assure their quality. Testing these systems, due to their inherent co mplex ities a nd  spec ial ch arac teristics, is complex, time-consuming and challenging. In this paper a novel multi-agent framework for automated testing of web- based systems is presented. The main design goals have been to develop an effective and flexible framework that sup-ports differen t types of te sts and  utilize differen t sources of  informa tion ab out the system  unde r test to auto mate the test process. A prototype of the proposed framework has been implemented and is used to perform some experiments. The results are promising and prove the overall design of the framework
