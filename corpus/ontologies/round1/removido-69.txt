Testing as a Service over Cloud
Abstract:  Testing-as-a-service (TaaS) is a new model to provide testing capabilities to end users. Users save the cost of complicated maintenance and upgrade effort, and service providers can upgrade their services without impact on the end-users. Due to uneven volumes of concurrent requests, it is important to address the elasticity of TaaS platform in a cloud environment. Scheduling and dispatching algorithms are developed to improve the utilization of computing resources. We develop a prototype of TaaS over cloud, and evaluate the scalability of the platform by increasing the test task load, analyze the distribution of computing time on test task scheduling and test task processing over the cloud, and examine the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing others
