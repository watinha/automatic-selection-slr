An Agent-based Approach for the Maintenance of Database Applications
Abstract:
Database systems lie at the core of almost every modern software application. The interaction between the application source code and the underlying database schema results in a dependency relationship that affects the application 's maintainability by raising a number of additional maintenance issues. To assess this effect and facilitate the maintenance process, a software engineering approach based on software agents is introduced. The distributed and cooperative nature of a software agent system provides the flexibility required to analyze modern multi-tier database applications such as web-based applications. A prototype system, which employs agent architecture in order to satisfy the requirements of the suggested approach, is presented.
