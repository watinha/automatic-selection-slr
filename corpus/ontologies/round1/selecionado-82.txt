Black box test case prioritization techniques for semantic based composite web services using OWL-S
Abstract:  Web services are the basic building blocks for the business which is different from web applications. Testing of web services is difficult and increases the cost due to the unavailability of source code. Researchers have, web services are tested based on the syntactic structure using Web Service Description Language (WSDL) for atomic web services. This paper proposes an automated testing framework for composite web services based on semantics where the domain knowledge of the web services is described using prote?ge? tool and the behaviour of the entire business operation flow for the composite web service is described by Ontology Web Language for services (OWL-S). Prioritization of test cases is performed based on various coverage criteria for composite web services. Series of experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of prioritization and empirical results shown that prioritization techniques perform well in detecting faults compared to traditional techniques.
