Desenvolvimento e avaliacao de um registro de servicos de ferramentas de teste
An important mechanism of Service Oriented Architecture is the service registry (or service broker). It allows interaction among providers and consumers, offering a point to access the services developed and published in the registry. In this dissertation we propose the development of a service broker to support the publication, search and categorization of Web services, particularly those related to software testing tools. A common limitation of service brokers refers to searching facilities since they are primarily syntactic and thus can bring results that are not well related with the user's interest. To tackle this problem a test ontology was adapted and incorporated into the broker with the aim of improving the likelihood of finding the correct service in searches and also to add semantic information to the registered services. A generic service oriented architecture for the software engineering domain is presented and instantiated to the software testing domain with the purpose of facilitating the understanding and implementation of the proposed service registry. We also present some examples of software testing tools published in the registry and an example of search and interaction with the JaBUTiWS testing service, previously published in the registry, which aims to support structural testing of components and services
