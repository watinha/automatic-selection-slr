Approaches to Functional, Structural and Security SOA Testing
Abstract  In this chapter, we provide an overview of recently proposed approaches and tools for functional and structural testing of SOA services. Typically, these two classes of approaches have been considered separately. However, since they focus on different perspectives, they are generally non-conflicting and could be used in a complementary way. Accordingly, we make an attempt at such a combination, briefly showing the approach and some preliminary results of the experimentation. The combined approach provides encouraging results from the point of view of the achievements and the degree of automation obtained. A very important concern in designing and developing web services is security. In the chapter we also discuss the security testing challenges and the currently proposed solutions.
