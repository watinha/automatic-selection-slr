The Use of Ontology in Case Based Reasoning for Reusable Test Case Generation
Abstract As we know, software testing is an important part of software development lifecycle. More than 50% of the whole system development work and total cost were spend on the software testing. And itï¿½s estimated that almost 60% of the total test time and cost were spent on the design of test cases. In recent years, the automated testing gradually replaces the traditional manual testing to become an important branch of software testing. In automated testing, the most important thing is to design and generate valid test case automatically. In this paper, In order to reduce the workload of testers on the test case generation, improve the test efficiency and makes test experiences be passed on, we design a common description method for the test case based on ontology; propose a semantic similarity measure method to retrieve the usable test cases from test case library based on WordNet; establish the relationship between the test case and test requirement though rules to modify the retrieved test case; generate the final test case sequence. At last, the practical applicability of the approach is evaluated through an experiment.
