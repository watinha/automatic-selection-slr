Prioritizing Structurally Complex Test Pairs for Validating WS-BPEL Evolutions
Abstract:  Many web services represent their artifacts in the semi-structural format. Such artifacts may or may not be structurally complex. Many existing test case prioritization techniques however treat test cases of different complexity generically. In this paper, we exploit the insights on the structural similarity of XML-based artifacts between test cases, and propose a family of test case prioritization techniques that iteratively selects test case pairs without replacement. The validation experiment shows that these techniques can be more cost-effective than the studied existing techniques in exposing faults.
