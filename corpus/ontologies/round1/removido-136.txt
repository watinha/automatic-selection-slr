Testing as a Service (TaaS) on Clouds
Abstract: Cloud computing leads an opportunity in offering testing as a service (TaaS) for SaaS, clouds, and cloud-based applications. This brings new business opportunities, challenges, and demands in innovative service models, testing techniques, QoS standards, and requirements. This paper provides a comprehensive tutorial on testing as a service in a cloud environment. It answers the common questions raised by engineers and managers, and provides clear conceptual discussions about testing as a service (TaaS), including its scope, objectives, motivations and values, distinct features, required techniques, as well as testing environments. It not only presents a classification of different types of testing services in TaaS, but also offers a clear comparative view and perspectives between conventional software testing service and cloud-based testing as a service. In addition, it examines underlying issues, challenges, and emergent needs.
