Multi-attribute Comparison of Automated Functional and Regression Testing Tools using Fuzzy AHP
Abstract. Software Testing is a process used to help in improving quality and efficiency of a software product. In order to make the testing process less time consuming and efficient Automated Testing Tools are being used. The correct choice of an automated testing tool is a critical success factor for the developed product to reach and maintain market leadership. In the current paper a model for selecting an automated functional and regression testing tool using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is presented. The FAHP is used to compare the Testing Tools. The means of the triangular Fuzzy numbers produced by the experts from different CMM level 5 organizations were successfully used in the pair-wise comparison matrix.
