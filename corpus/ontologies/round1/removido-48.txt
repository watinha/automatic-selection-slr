Survey on Collaborative Testing of Web Services
The foremost realization of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is Web Services (WS). It defines a  framework for nimble and adaptable amalgamation among self directed services based on Internet open standards.  SOA allows composition of distributed applications free from their platform and thus reduces the cost of such  compositions and makes them easier and faster to develop. However, testing has been confronted due the vibrant  and collaborative nature of WS. This paper analyses the key techniques present in testing of WS and shows the  strength and weakness of current web service testing technology.
