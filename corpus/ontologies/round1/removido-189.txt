TASSA: A Testing as a Service Framework for Web Service Compositions
Testing-as-a-Service (TaaS) is a new quality assurance model addressing the challenges of software testing  in the cloud. The missing access to the hardware or different software configurations as well as the difficulties  of building a test environment are examples for common problems in the testing process. This paper addresses  such problems by proposing a TaaS-enabled framework offering testing services on as-needed basis. The  framework, called Testing as a Service Software Architecture (TASSA), supports testing of web service  compositions described with Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (WS-BPEL). Its core  functionality includes fault injection and dependencies isolation of the application under test. It is  implemented as web services deployed on cloud infrastructure. In addition, the TASSA Graphical User  Interface (GUI) for test case design and execution is implemented as a plugin for Eclipse IDE. It could be  accessed from a local computer or used for building a cloud test lab on a virtual machine. Sample business  process from wine industry is used for proving the feasibility of TASSA framework
