Regression Testing of Web Services Using Parsing and Test case Prioritization Approach
Abstract- Web services are the basic building blocks for
every e-business applications now s- a-day. They provide
efficient reusability mechanism, thereby reducing the
development time and cost. Mostly the source code of web
services is unavailable to other developers who use these
services. Thus automated testing needs to be developed for
testing these web services, which is possible by adding
semantics to web services description language (WSDL).
Also the test case reduction technique is very much
required for regression testing. Previous work generates
test cases for web services using case pri8oritization is
need to done in reducing the test effort for web services
using reducing techniques pair wise testing (PWT) and
orthogonal array testing (OAT).in this work test case
prioritization is need to done in reducing the testing effort
for regression testing. To implement priority base testing
than find test specification for web based data. After that
perform orthogonal testing, pair wise testing and compare
with strength generation.
