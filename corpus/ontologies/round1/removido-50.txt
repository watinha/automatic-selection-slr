IMPROVING DEVELOPMENT TIMES BY REUSING FLEXIBLE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COMPONENT
Abstract: Product development time estimation is important for project management tasks. This study investigates the impact of requirements reuse on product development duration for different products in a similar domain. We propose an analytical tool to estimate the minimum time to be saved given the percentage of requirements reused from earlier projects. This paper presents basis for the formal reuse of hardware components as a strategy to reduce the task for verifying new hardware elements. Assuming the existence of a library of formally verified hardware components, we propose to make effective reuse of these existing elements when creating new ones. The concept of software component reuse is simple: the idea of building and using "software preferred parts." By building systems out of carefully designed, pre-tested components, one will save the cost of designing, writing and testing new code. The practice of reuse has not proven to be this simple however, and there are many misconceptions about how to implement and gain benefit from software reuse. One case from organization has been studied for software and system development projects, which consist of hardware and software components. The results of the case studies are compared with a study in the literature on product development time.
