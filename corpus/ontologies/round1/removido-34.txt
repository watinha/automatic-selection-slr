A Survey on Technique for Dynamic Test Reconfiguration for Composite Web Services
This project will introduces a testing policy that is appropriate  for testing service-based applications. And enhance web service  performance. I describe an architecture that responds to changes  of service operation , arguments and changed service  composition. To prove test system performs runtime testing by  random testing technique on my model atomic and composite  web services. to support the continuous operation of the testing  systems during a test candidate change done by Automated  reconfiguration.
