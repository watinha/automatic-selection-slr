A Metamorphic Testing Methodology for Online SOA Application Testing
ABSTRACT
Testing the correctness of service integration is a step toward assurance of the quality of applications.
These applications however may bind dynamically to their supportive services using the SOA pattern that
share the same service interface, yet the latter services may behave differently. In addition, a service may
implement a business strategy, such as best pricing, relative to the behaviors of its competitors and the
dynamic market conditions. As such, defining a test oracle that specifies the absolute expected outcomes
for individual test cases is hard. Many existing works ignore these issues to address the problem of
identifying failures from test results. This chapter studies an approach to online testing. Service testing is
divided into two steps. In the spirit of metamorphic testing, the offline step determines a set of successful
test cases to construct their corresponding follow-up test cases for the online step. These test cases will be
executed by metamorphic services that encapsulate the services as well as applicable metamorphic
relations. Thus, any failure revealed by the approach will be a failure of the service under test.
