Ontology-Based Web Application Testing
Abstract- Testing Web applications is still a
challenging work which can greatly benefit from
test automation techniques. In this paper, we focus
on using ontologies as a means of test automation.
Current works that use ontologies for software
testing are discussed. Further a theoretical
roadmap is presented, with some examples, on
ontology-based web application testing.
