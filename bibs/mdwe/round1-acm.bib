	abstract = {In the last few years, almost all model-driven Web Engineering approaches have evolved in response to the new challenges of Web systems design, which are due to new requirements and implementation technologies in the Web domain. The evolution implies the extension and adaptation of current approaches, in terms of new models, transformations and processes in order to incorporate new concerns or aspects. Such changes in a methodology are a risky and error-prone process. In this paper, we analyze different alternatives to address the evolution and in particular, the addition of a new concern in a {Model-Driven} Web Engineering approach: (a) extending the original method with an additional modeling concern, (b) merging the original proposal with another approach covering the specific concern and, (c) finally, we propose a an interoperable and architectural-centric approach that aims to reduce the impact of adding a new concern. We discuss the main advantages and drawbacks of each alternative.},

	abstract = {System theory propagates the use of models which raise the level of abstraction to cope with complexity, evolving out of variety and connectivity. Different modeling techniques have been invented for the abstract description of certain aspects of dynamic system behaviour. Nowadays process models are also an accepted part of service oriented process design. Although service oriented architecture {(SOA)} is the aim, rather isolated processes are the starting point for executable code generation and not the changing functionality distribution the system offers. Thus we claim the system view, necessary for process lifecycle management, is missing. Moreover, in the context of Web Service Composition, a vertical, bi- directional model driven approach allows for manifold allocation of e.g. testing, validation or binding tasks within the layer stack of {MDAs} (model driven architecture). In this paper we discuss two distinctive proposals for model driven service composition, followed by a comparison of representative mapping scenarios offered by {IBM} and Microsoft.},

Unless course content is developed by leveraging instructional design principles combined with opportunities offered by Information Technology, these problems will only proliferate as commercial and other considerations are forcing the best of teaching institutions to support web-based learning. Not all teachers can be expected to formally apply instructional design principles when putting their courses onto the web. A clean and simple model that can be used to templatize and thus simplify the task of educational content development is essential. In this paper the authors first briefly describe one such model followed by details of two real-life experimental efforts undertaken to develop courseware following this model. The model is based on small meaningful units of instruction - a concept, the interrelationship amongst concepts, type of knowledge intended to be imparted, expected performance level, instructional events and learning experience. Of the two courses, one has already been deployed and detailed feedback is being collected. The second course is also rolled out and the results from this will be available by July 2002.},

Frameworks implementing the {Model-View-Controller} architectural pattern standardize the development process to a great extent, while business layer components may consist of consumers of existing web services. On this line of thought a web application can be seen as a composition of web services around a user interface flow. In this paper, an approach for the application of model-driven techniques for the automation of the development of such a web application is presented. Specifically, we present a methodology for the modeling of the application using {UML} state transition and class diagrams and the generation of the appropriate source code and configuration files. The appropriate {UML} profiles to assist the service design are defined and the final transformation is performed exploiting model parsing tools.},

In this paper, a methodology of {Model-Driven} Testing {(MDT)} for Web application is presented. Model is the core of this method. Web application model is built to describe the system under testing. Test case models are generated based-on the web application model. Test deployment model and test control model are designed to describe the environment and process of test execution. The test engine executes test cases based-on the test deployment and control model automatically. After that, testing results are reflected to test case models. A framework is designed for supporting this methodology. In order to get better extensibility and flexibility, it is loose-coupled by a modeler and a tester. The modeler enables developers to design meta-models, and is responsible for creating, visualizing and saving models. The tester takes in charge of recovering the tested Web application model, generating test cases, and executing test.},

Various modeling languages, just as in the web engineering field, however, are not based on metamodels and standards but instead define proprietary languages rather focused on notational aspects. Thus, {MDE} techniques and tools can not be deployed for such languages. The {WebML} web modeling language is one example that does not yet rely on an explicit metamodel. Instead, it is implicitly defined within the accompanying tool in terms of a document type definition {(DTD),} i.e., a grammar-like textual definition for specifying the structure of {XML} documents. Code generation then has to rely on {XSLT-based} model-to-code {transformations.In} this paper, we propose a metamodel for {WebML} which is based on the Meta Object Facility {(MOF).} To establish such a metamodel a semi-automatic approach is provided that allows to generate {MOF-based} metamodels from {DTDs.} The metamodel for {WebML} accomplishes the following aims: First, it represents an initial step towards a transition to employing {MDE} techniques (e.g., model transformations or language extensions through profiles) within the {WebML} design methodology. Second, it represents an important step towards a common metamodel for Web modeling. Third, the provision of a {MOF-based} metamodel ensures interoperability with other {MDE} tools.},

However, existing web application development approaches treat data management operations as second-class citizens. They integrate data operations into existing models or derive them as a by-product of business processes. We argue that data management is an important part of the application logic hence we capture operations with an additional Operation Model. We show that the explicit modeling of operations provides many benefits that distinguish our solution from other approaches. We present the {flashWeb} development process utilizing a graphical notation for the models in use, a {CAWE} tool that supports the creation of the graphical models and a code generator that creates ready-to-run web applications.},

	abstract = {The growing scale and complexity of the enterprise computing systems under distributed and heterogeneous environments present new challenges to system development, integration, and maintenance. In this paper, we present a model driven Web service development framework to combat these challenges. The framework capitalizes on the unified modeling language {(UML)} profile for enterprise distributed object computing {(EDOC),} {MDA} (model-driven architecture) and Web services. Within the framework, firstly, a general {PIM} (platform independent models) is created using the {EDOC} {CCA} structural specification and {CCA} choreography specification which defines the general functions of a system. Secondly, the general {PIM} is broken down into {sub-PIMs} according to functional decomposition, each of which can provide service independently and will be implemented in a Web service.

	abstract = {The Sixth International Conference on Web Engineering {(ICWE} 2006) held in Palo Alto, California, at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, hosted the workshops {MDWE,} {AEWSE} and {SMIWEP-MATeS.} This volume of the {ACM} Digital Library contains a selection of papers presented at the three workshops which took place on July, 10th and July, {11th.ICWE} 2006 and the associated workshops aim to promote research and scientific exchange related to Web Engineering and to bring together practitioners, scientists and researchers, as well as those interested in learning more about Web Engineering. The Web Engineering discipline comprises the development and use of models, methodologies, technologies, tools and techniques that are used to develop and maintain Web applications within economic constraints. In the era of Web-based information and services we are living in, the development of such Web systems is demanding our attention in order to provide sound and engineered solutions to specific problems in the Web Engineering field. The articles presented at the {ICWE} 2006 workshops have proposed novel results in this area focusing each on a specific {domain:The} Second International Workshop on {Model-Driven} Web Engineering {(MDWE'06)} focused on model-based and model-driven development of Web applications. The main goal of this workshop series is to promote the use of models and model transformations as well as the definition of domain specific modeling languages {(DSML)} and construction of {CASE} tools supporting model-driven processes. Strengths and weaknesses of model-driven approaches in the Web domain were lively discussed during the {workshop.The} First International Workshop on Adaptation and Evolution in Web Systems Engineering {(AEWSE'06)} aimed at bringing together researchers and practitioners with different research interests, belonging to communities like Web Engineering, Adaptive Hypermedia, User Modeling, Active Databases, Semantic Web, Ontology Evolution, Database Evolution, Temporal Data, Software Engineering and Mobile Computing. The goal of the workshop was to address adaptation and evolution of Web applications both during design, implementation and {deployment.The} Joint Workshop on Web Services Modeling and Implementation using Sound Web Engineering Practices and Methods, Architectures \& Technologies for {e-Service} Engineering {(SMIWEP-MATeS'06)} covered current state-of-the-art and best practices in {e-Service} engineering, focusing on aspects such as development of semantic Web applications, integration of technologies, requirements engineering, patterns and reference architectures, design methodologies and processes and quality models.},

	abstract = {Current model-driven Web engineering approaches provide methods and compilers for the effective design and development of Web applications. However, these proposals also have some limitations, especially when it comes to exchanging model specifications or adding further concerns such as architectural styles, technology independence, or distribution. One solution to these issues is based on the possibility of making Web proposals interoperate, being able to complement each other, and to exchange models between their tools. We analyze how a common reference model shared by Web engineering proposals can be effectively used to achieve the desired interoperability. We also examine how such a common reference model can be used to combine models coming from different proposals, and discuss the problems that can occur when integrating these separate models. Finally, we show how high-level model transformations allow to efficiently solving these problems. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this paper, we present a method-independent approach to combine the agile, iterative and incremental style of test-driven development with the more formal, transformation-based model-driven Web engineering approaches. We focus not only in the development process but also in the evolution of the application, and show how tests can be transformed together with model refactoring.

The disadvantage of this way is that the system must be implemented before performing the test. As a consequence, developers must solve the usability issues in the last stages of the development process. Currently, the model-driven software development is gaining popularity as a solution to reduce changes impact. In this paper, a usability model is proposed to evaluate early usability from the conceptual schemas that represents a Web Application. This approach allows to incorporate usability improvements before the implementation of the final web application. We evaluate the usability of artefacts modelled with {OOWS,} a model-driven web engineering method. In addition, two case studies are used to verify the instruments proposed to evaluate our early usability model.},

	abstract = {Today's Web applications require instruments and techniques able to face their complexity which has noticeably increased at the expense of productivity and quality factors. A number of design methodologies have been proposed in the process of trying to provide developers with languages and tools to abstract and capture Web applications under orthogonal views, like data, navigation and presentation. While the different modeling language constructs can be unified in a common metamodel, consistency among the distinct concerns is guaranteed by less formal relations. Usually, they are based on name conventions and/or ad hoc tool support that could affect reuse and maintenance ratings of specifications. In order to define rigorous and explicit correspondences between the artifacts produced during a system development, this paper proposes the exploitation of dedicated weaving models. The approach aims at providing structural mappings that do not interfere with the definition of the views on either side achieving a clear separation between them and their connections. Furthermore, following the ''everything is a model'' principle, this work can enable the use of general-purpose theories and tools. For example, model transformations can be applied to evaluate the given specifications or to derive alternative descriptions like Webile or {WebML.}},

However, Web Engineering differs significantly from general Software Engineering and a number of well-established {non-MDD} solutions already exist in that field. This leads to several interesting questions, which have been left unanswered so far. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing whether the problems encountered in the field of Web Engineering can really be solved with {MDD} approaches. We also answer the questions whether {MDD} will be able to solve these problems better and/or cheaper than traditional Web Engineering approaches and whether the current Web {MDD} propositions live up to this potential. While answering these questions, we will show that there exists a great synergy between the two groups and that the success of {MDD} in the Web domain will depend on exploiting the strengths of both.},

However, recent studies reveal that a high percentage of these projects fail to attain the quality parameters required by stakeholders. The inadequate consideration of requirements management activities together with the absence of attention to the elicitation and evaluation of requirements and metrics related to certain quality attributes which are of special importance in this kind of systems, such as usability, have proved to be some of the main causes of this failure. This paper attempts to reduce some of the quality failures detected in Web Engineering development projects by proposing the consideration and evaluation of quality attributes from early stages of the development process. The presented approach therefore commences with a reinforcement of the requirements related activities in this discipline, which is carried out by using a requirements metamodel. Once these requirements have been identified, the approach focuses on the extension of the conceptual models used by Web Engineering methodologies with the aim of allowing the explicit consideration of usability requirements along with the evaluation of quality metrics during the design of the system. An example of an application illustrating how the approach can be used, along with the automatic support which was developed for it, are also shown.},

	abstract = {Multichannel Adaptive Web Information Systems {(WISs)} are emerging as a new class of information systems, characterized by their powerful use of mobility and context-awareness. Different methodologies have been proposed so far for the analysis and design of Multichannel Adaptive {WISs,} specifically focused on the front-end layer or the back-end layer, but no methodology has aimed to cover all the lifecycle and to design all the components that characterize Multichannel Adaptive {WIS.} This paper fills such a gap, by presenting {UM-MAIS} {(Unified} Methodology for Multichannel Adaptive Information Systems), a new methodology that capitalizes on well-established existing methods. It supports the analysis and design of the various components of Multichannel Adaptive {WISs} (including the user's experience) in a comprehensive and unified manner with special emphasis on context modeling, personalization, and adaptation.},

In this article we are interested in developing a reactive design through process log analysis ensuring process re-engineering and execution reliability. We propose to analyse workflow logs to discover workflow transactional behaviour and to subsequently improve and correct related recovery mechanisms. Our approach starts by collecting workflow logs. Then, we build, by statistical analysis techniques, an intermediate representation specifying elementary dependencies between activities. These dependencies are refined to mine the transactional workflow model. The analysis of the discrepancies between the discovered model and the initially designed model enables us to detect design gaps, concerning particularly the recovery mechanisms. Thus, based on this mining step, we apply a set of rules on the initially designed workflow to improve workflow reliability.},

Our method is based on existing models for the specification of business processes {(BPMN)} combined with Web engineering models for designing and developing semantically rich Web applications {(WebML).} The proposed approach leads from an abstract view of the business needs to a concrete implementation of the application by means of several design steps; high-level models are transformed into software components.

This prevents deploying adaptable web services. In this paper, we propose a semantic- and context-based approach for web services composition. By semantics, we mean the capacity of web services, which are engaged in interactions, to understand what these interactions are about and how to carry out these interactions.

The presented tool chain covers modelling with domain-specific Unified Modelling Language {(UML)} profiles, transformation of the {UML} models into Web Services Definition Language {(WSDL)} files, and Java code generation. The tool chain is validated in a case study where it is used in the development of a web service called Resource Availability Service {(RAS).} In the validation, the tool chain worked well, since the proportion of generated code in {RAS} is over 95\%. The residual 5\% of the code includes manual integration and business logic. User experiences indicate that using the tool chain improves the developer productivity in Web Services development.},

Seamless exchange of models among different modeling tools increasingly becomes a crucial prerequisite for effective software development processes. Due to lack of interoperability, however, it is often difficult to use tools in combination, thus the potential of model-driven software development cannot be fully utilized. To tackle this problem, we propose {ModelCVS,} a system aiming at model-based tool integration. {ModelCVS} enables transparent transformation of models between different tools' languages and exchange formats, as well as versioning exploiting the rich syntax and semantics of models, thus going beyond existing low-level model transformation approaches. For this, {ModelCVS} utilizes semantic technologies in terms of ontologies and supports different integration patterns at the metamodel level. To foster reuse, a knowledge base captures essential information relevant for tool integration.},

	abstract = {In service-oriented architectures, everything is a service and everyone is a service provider. Web services (or simply services) are loosely coupled software components that are published, discovered, and invoked across the Web. As the use of Web service grows, in order to correctly interact with them, it is important to understand the business protocols that provide clients with the information on how to interact with services. In dynamic Web service environments, service providers need to constantly adapt their business protocols for reflecting the restrictions and requirements proposed by new applications, new business strategies, and new laws, or for fixing problems found in the protocol definition. However, the effective management of such a protocol evolution raises critical problems: one of the most critical issues is how to handle instances running under the old protocol when it has been changed. Simple solutions, such as aborting them or allowing them to continue to run according to the old protocol, can be considered, but they are inapplicable for many reasons (for example, the loss of work already done and the critical nature of work). In this article, we present a framework that supports service managers in managing the business protocol evolution by providing several features, such as a variety of protocol change impact analyses automatically determining which ongoing instances can be migrated to the new version of protocol, and data mining techniques inferring interaction patterns used for classifying ongoing instances migrateable to the new protocol. To support the protocol evolution process, we have also developed database-backed {GUI} tools on top of our existing system. The proposed approach and tools can help service managers in managing the evolution of ongoing instances when the business protocols of services with which they are interacting have changed.},

	abstract = {Web services are increasingly gaining acceptance as a framework for facilitating application-to-application interactions within and across enterprises. It is commonly accepted that a service description should include not only the interface, but also the business protocol supported by the service. The present work focuses on the formalization of an important category of protocols that includes time-related constraints (called timed protocols), and the impact of time on compatibility and replaceability analysis. We formalized the following timing constraints: {C-Invoke} constraints define time windows within which a service operation can be invoked while {M-Invoke} constraints define expiration deadlines. We extended techniques for compatibility and replaceability analysis between timed protocols by using a semantic-preserving mapping between timed protocols and timed automata, leading to the identification of a novel class of timed automata, called protocol timed automata {(PTA).} {PTA} exhibit a particular kind of silent transition that strictly increase the expressiveness of the model, yet they are closed under complementation, making every type of compatibility or replaceability analysis decidable. Finally, we implemented our approach in the context of a larger project called {ServiceMosaic,} a model-driven framework for Web service life-cycle management.},

	abstract = {Web service-based development represents an emerging approach for the development of distributed information systems. Web services have been mainly applied by software practitioners as a means to modularize system functionality that can be offered across a network (e.g., intranet and/or the Internet). Although web services have been predominantly developed as a technical solution for integrating software systems, there is a more business-oriented aspect that developers and enterprises need to deal with in order to benefit from the full potential of web services in an electronic market. This `ignored' aspect is the representation of the semantics underlying the services themselves as well as the `things' that the services manage. Currently languages like the Web Services Description Language {(WSDL)} provide the syntactic means to describe web services, but lack in providing a semantic underpinning. In order to harvest all the benefits of web services technology, a framework has been developed for deriving business semantics from syntactic descriptions of web services. The benefits of such a framework are two-fold. Firstly, the framework provides a way to gradually construct domain ontologies from previously defined technical services. Secondly, the framework enables the migration of syntactically defined web services toward semantic web services. The study follows a design research approach which (1) identifies the problem area and its relevance from an industrial case study and previous research, (2) develops the framework as a design artifact and (3) evaluates the application of the framework through a relevant scenario.},

This paper illustrates an evolutionary approach for incorporating a wealth of {RIA} features into an existing Web engineering methodology and notation. The experience demonstrates that it is possible to model {RIA} application requirements at a high-level using a platform-independent notation, and generate the client-side and server-side code automatically.

	abstract = {Several methods for enterprise systems analysis rely on flow-oriented representations of business operations, otherwise known as business process models. The Business Process Modeling Notation {(BPMN)} is a standard for capturing such models. {BPMN} models facilitate communication between domain experts and analysts and provide input to software development projects. Meanwhile, there is an emergence of methods for enterprise software development that rely on detailed process definitions that are executed by process engines. These process definitions refine their counterpart {BPMN} models by introducing data manipulation, application binding, and other implementation details. The de facto standard for defining executable processes is the Business Process Execution Language {(BPEL).} Accordingly, a standards-based method for developing process-oriented systems is to start with {BPMN} models and to translate these models into {BPEL} definitions for subsequent refinement. However, instrumenting this method is challenging because {BPMN} models and {BPEL} definitions are structurally very different. Existing techniques for translating {BPMN} to {BPEL} only work for limited classes of {BPMN} models. This article proposes a translation technique that does not impose structural restrictions on the source {BPMN} model. At the same time, the technique emphasizes the generation of readable (block-structured) {BPEL} code. An empirical evaluation conducted over a large collection of process models shows that the resulting {BPEL} definitions are largely block-structured. Beyond its direct relevance in the context of {BPMN} and {BPEL,} the technique presented in this article addresses issues that arise when translating from graph-oriented to block-structure flow definition languages.},

In this paper we show how domain specific model integration languages can be defined, and how they can be composed in order to achieve complex model management tasks. Thereby, we base our approach on the definition of declarative model integration languages, of which implementing transformations are derived. We give a categorization of these transformations and rely on an object-oriented mechanism to realize complex model management tasks.},

Combining {SOA} with features to support dynamic service discovery, management and binding, increase the chances that an architecture configuration has been incorrectly specified. To facilitate service engineers designing and implementing service systems we introduced the notion of Service Modes, that at design time provide an abstraction of service configurations given particular requirements for runtime. This paper describes how behaviour protocols are included in these configurations and how properties of combined architecture and behaviour models can be used to perform some useful analysis to assure dynamic service architecture configurations are safer and more resilient to incompatibilities. The modelling and analysis techniques are supported by an implementation in the {LTSA} {WS-Engineer,} a comprehensive integrated tool suite for verification and validation of service compositions.},

	abstract = {Model-based user interface {(UI)} development environments are aimed at generating one or many {UIs} from a single model or a family of models. Model-driven engineering {(MDE)} of {UIs} is assumed to be superior to those environments since they make the {UI} design knowledge visible, explicit, and external, for instance as model-to-model transformations and model-to-code compilation rules. These transformations and rules are often considered inflexible, complex to express, and hard to develop by {UI} designers and developers who are not necessarily experts in {MDE.} In order to overcome these shortcomings, this work introduces the concept of transformation profile that consists of two definitions: model mappings, which connect source and target models in a flexible way, and transformation templates, which gather high-level parameters to apply to transformations. This work applies these concepts in a general-purpose method for {MDE} of information systems. Transformation profiles can be effectively and efficiently used in any circumstances in which transformation knowledge needs to be modified by non-experts, and flexibility, modifiability, and customization are required.},

	abstract = {When a large amount of data is stored in {OWL} files, it is not efficient to maintain and query those data. The {OWL} syntax is based on {XML,} which is a meta-markup language. Thus, it is suitable for data description and data exchange, rather than for data storage and data management. Furthermore, enabling multiple users to work with the same ontology in parallel and make modifications mandates the use of databases (e.g. object-relational) for storing ontologies. Therefore, this paper proposes to extract data from {OWL} files and store those data in object-relational databases. Object-relational databases are good for data storage and data management. But {OWL} is semantically richer than {SQL3.} As a result, some of the semantics captured in ontologies can be lost when ontologies are stored in object-relational databases. In addition, some of the structures of ontologies can be lost. E.g. a class in an ontology can be stored as it were an atomic undifferentiated piece of data in a single {CLOB} column in an object-relational database. When the ontology is stored in such a way, the query and scalability features of the object-relational database cannot be fully exploited to access the data.},

In such a context, service providers are strategically interested both to describe the performance characteristics of offered services, to better qualify their offer and gain a significant advantage in the global marketplace; and to predict the level of performance that can be offered to service consumers. To this purpose, the paper introduces a framework for the management of performance parameters, defining the architecture that enables service providers to measure and make available performance information about the offered services. On the other hand the proposed approach allows the service consumers to automatically retrieve the performance data and then use such data to apply model-driven approaches for the performance analysis of composite web services.},

Significant efforts are currently being invested in application integration, to support the composition of business processes of different companies, so as to create complex, multiparty business scenarios. In this setting, Web applications, which were originally conceived to allow the user-to-system dialogue, are extended with Web services, which enable system-to-system interaction, and with process control primitives, which permit the implementation of the required business constraints. This article presents new Web engineering methods for the high-level specification of applications featuring business processes and remote services invocation. Process- and service-enabled Web applications benefit from the high-level modeling and automatic code generation techniques that have been fruitfully applied to conventional Web applications, broadening the class of Web applications that take advantage of these powerful software engineering techniques.

We analyse the relation between the Semantic Web and the Web, and survey the typical data access patterns in Semantic Web applications. We discuss the mismatch between object-oriented programming languages and Semantic Web data, for example in the semantics of class membership, inheritance relations, and object conformance to schemas. We present {ActiveRDF,} an object-oriented {API} for managing {RDF} data that offers full manipulation and querying of {RDF} data, does not rely on a schema and fully conforms to {RDF(S)} semantics. {ActiveRDF} can be used with different {RDF} data stores: adapters have been implemented to generic {SPARQL} endpoints, Sesame, Jena, Redland and {YARS} and new adapters can be added easily. We demonstrate the usage of {ActiveRDF} and its integration with the popular Ruby on Rails framework which enables rapid development of Semantic Web applications.},

The conceptual schema is then translated into a “traditional” database schema, which describes both the organization of the content and the desired navigation and presentation features.

In this context, this article proposes a framework for the automation of the Web service contract specification and establishment. An extensible model for defining both domain-dependent and domain-independent Web service {QoS} dimensions and a method for the automation of the contract establishment phase are proposed. We describe a matchmaking algorithm for the ranking of functionally equivalent services, which orders services on the basis of their ability to fulfill the service requestor requirements, while maintaining the price below a specified budget. We also provide an algorithm for the configuration of the negotiable part of the {QoS} {Service-Level} Agreement {(SLA),} which is used to configure the agreement with the top-ranked service identified in the matchmaking phase. Experimental results show that, in a utility theory perspective, the contract establishment phase leads to efficient outcomes. We envision two advanced application scenarios for the Web service contracting framework proposed in this article. First, it can be used to enhance Web services self-healing properties in reaction to {QoS-related} service failures; second, it can be exploited in process optimization for the online reconfiguration of candidate Web services {QoS} {SLAs.}},

They implemented this framework in a prototype platform called Service Mosaic.},

	abstract = {In the area of Web services and service-oriented architectures, business protocols are rapidly gaining importance and mindshare as a necessary part of Web service descriptions. Their immediate benefit is that they provide developers with information on how to write clients that can correctly interact with a given service or with a set of services. In addition, once protocols become an accepted practice and service descriptions become endowed with protocol information, the middleware can be significantly extended to better support service development, binding, and execution in a number of ways, considerably simplifying the whole service life-cycle. This paper discusses the different ways in which the middleware can leverage protocol descriptions, and focuses in particular on the notions of protocol compatibility, equivalence, and replaceability. They characterize whether two services can interact based on their protocol definition, whether a service can replace another in general or when interacting with specific clients, and which are the set of possible interactions among two services.},

In order to realize such adaptive behavior, Web engineers are thus faced with an additional challenge: engineering the required adaptation concerns. In this article, we present, in the context of a {WIS} design method, an adaptation engineering process that is separated from the regular Web design process. Our approach is based on the use of two key elements: (1) aspect-oriented techniques to achieve the separation of (adaptation) concerns; and (2) the exploitation of semantic information and metadata associated with the content, for enhanced expressivity and flexibility. By combining these key elements, we demonstrate a robust, rich, consistent, and flexible way to specify adaptation in {WISs.}},

	abstract = {Business process modeling and enactment are notoriously complex, especially in open settings, where business partners are autonomous, requirements must be continually finessed, and exceptions frequently arise because of real-world or organizational problems. Traditional approaches, which attempt to capture processes as monolithic flows, have proven inadequate in addressing these challenges. We propose (business) protocols as components for developing business processes. A protocol is an abstract, modular, publishable specification of an interaction among different roles to be played by different participants. When instantiated with the participants' internal policies, protocols yield concrete business processes. Protocols are reusable and refinable, thus simplifying business process design. We show how protocols and their composition are theoretically founded in the {\textbackslash}pi-calculus.},

Thus, most of these systems are not adapted to inter-enterprise cooperation. As we are interested in workflow processes, we aim, through this paper, to present a model supporting dynamic heterogeneous workflow process interconnection. We consider the interconnection of enterprise workflow processes as the management of a "workflow of workflows" in which several heterogeneous workflow systems coexist.

Unified Modeling Language {(UML),} a widely accepted object-oriented system modeling and design language, and adapted for software architecture descriptions for several years, has been used for the web system description recently. However, it is hard to detect the system problems, such as correctness, consistency etc., of the integration of Web services without a formal semantics of web services architecture. In this paper, we proposed an approach to solving this issue by translating the {UML} web service architecture description into a formal modeling language - {SO-SAM,} and verify the correctness of the web system design using model checking techniques. We presented this approach through an imaging processing scenario in the distributed web application.},

	abstract = {Portlet syndication is the next wave following the successful use of content syndication in current portals. Portlets can be regarded as Web components, and the portal as the component container where portlets are aggregated to provide higher-order applications. This perspective requires a departure from how current Web portals are envisaged. The portal is no longer perceived as a set of pages but as an integrated set of Web components that are now delivered through the portal. From this perspective, the portal page now acts as a mere conduit for portlets. Page and page navigation dilute in favor of portlet and portlet orchestration. However, the mapping from portlet orchestration (design time) to page navigation (implementation time) is too tedious and error prone. For instance, the fact that the same portlet can be placed in distinct pages produces code clones that are repeated along the pages that contain this portlet. This redundancy substantiates in the first place the effort to move to model-driven development. This work uses the {eXo} platform as the target {PSM,} and the {PIM} is based on Hypermedia Model Based on Statecharts. The paper shows how this approach accounts for portal validation/verification to be conducted earlier at the {PIM} level, and streamlines both design and implementation of {eXo} portals. A running example is used throughout the paper.},
