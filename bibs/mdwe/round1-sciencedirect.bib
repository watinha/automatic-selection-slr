	abstract = {Process interconnection mechanisms are necessary to coordinate geographically distributed business processes in order to strength awareness inside virtual enterprises, to facilitate multinational e-transactions, etc. Actually, existing business process modelling and enactment systems (workflow systems, project management tools, shared agendas, to do lists, etc.) have been mainly developed to suit enterprise internal needs. Thus, most of these systems are not adapted to inter-enterprise cooperation. As we are interested in workflow processes, we aim, through this paper, to present a model supporting dynamic heterogeneous workflow process interconnection. We consider the interconnection of enterprise workflow processes as the management of a "workflow of workflows" in which several heterogeneous workflow systems coexist. This paper introduces our process interconnection model, its implementation, and its validation through experimentation.},

	abstract = {Semantic Web applications share a large portion of development effort with database-driven Web applications. Existing approaches for development of these database-driven applications cannot be directly applied to Semantic Web data due to differences in the underlying data model. We develop a mapping approach that embeds Semantic Web data into object-oriented languages and thereby enables reuse of existing Web application frameworks.
We analyse the relation between the Semantic Web and the Web, and survey the typical data access patterns in Semantic Web applications. We discuss the mismatch between object-oriented programming languages and Semantic Web data, for example in the semantics of class membership, inheritance relations, and object conformance to schemas.
We present {ActiveRDF,} an object-oriented {API} for managing {RDF} data that offers full manipulation and querying of {RDF} data, does not rely on a schema and fully conforms to {RDF(S)} semantics. {ActiveRDF} can be used with different {RDF} data stores: adapters have been implemented to generic {SPARQL} endpoints, Sesame, Jena, Redland and {YARS} and new adapters can be added easily. We demonstrate the usage of {ActiveRDF} and its integration with the popular Ruby on Rails framework which enables rapid development of Semantic Web applications.},

	abstract = {Personalization of websites has become an important issue in Web modeling methods due to their big and heterogeneous audience. However, due to the existence of too many notations to represent the same design concepts in different methodologies, personalization specifications cannot be used out of the scope of a single tool or method. Moreover, in some cases, personalization is not defined as a separate aspect, being difficult to maintain and update. This paper tackles the aforementioned problems presenting a generic modeling technique to facilitate the specification of the personalization. Personalization specifications can be reused across different websites and different development environments.},
