	title = {Bridging {WebML} to model-driven engineering: from document type definitions to meta object facility},
	abstract = {Meta-models are a prerequisite for model-driven engineering {(MDE)} in general and consequently for model-driven web engineering in particular. Various web modelling languages, however, are not based on meta-models and standards, like object management group's prominent meta object facility {(MOF).} Instead they define proprietary languages rather focused on notational aspects. Thus, {MDE} techniques and tools cannot be deployed for such languages preventing to exploit the full potential of {MDE} in terms of standardised storage, exchange and transformation of models. The {WebML} web modelling language is one example that does not yet rely on an explicit meta-model in the sense of {MDE.} Instead, it is defined in terms of a document type definition {(DTD),} and implicitly within the accompanying tool. Code generation then has to rely on model-to-code transformations based of extensible stylesheet language transformations {(XSLT).} We propose a meta-model for {WebML} to bridge {WebML} to {MDE.} To establish such a meta-model, instead of remodelling {WebML's} meta-model from scratch, a semi-automatic approach is provided that allows generating {MOF-based} meta-models on the basis of {DTDs.} The meta-model for {WebML} accomplishes the following aims: first, it represents an initial step towards a transition to employ {MDE} techniques within the {WebML} design methodology. Second, the provision of a {MOF-based} meta-model ensures interoperability with other {MDE} tools. Third, it represents an important step towards a common meta-model for Web modelling in future.},
