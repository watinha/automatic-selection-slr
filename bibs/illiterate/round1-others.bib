	the problems that arise when the producers of a system come from
	a very different cultural and technological environment from the
	intended users of the system. This concept is proposed as an analysis
	framework whose purpose is twofold: to be used in the evaluation
	of how the context and local culture shape the utility and usability
	of interactive systems, both in their development and also once they
	are deployed to their actual contexts of use and to understand the
	dynamics of technical and interpersonal communication in communities
	of practice. This is illustrated with a case study about the ongoing

	In other words this serves to `delete the subject'. This disguises
	an implicit hierarchy of knowers involved in the representation of

	and build the systems over alternative perspectives. The privileged
	position reflects Western, professional masculinity. Alternative
	perspectives, denied a voice, belong to less powerful groups including
	women. Feminist epistemology can be used to approach this from new
	directions, in particular, to show how women's knowledge may be left
	out of consideration by AI's focus on masculine subjects. The paper
	uncovers the tacitly assumed Western professional male subjects in
	two flagship AI systems, Cyc and Soar.},

	are used to examine the complexities of the positivist/anti-positivist
	position and the related concept of emancipation. In addition, it

	the case of developing regions, we have the opposite problem: 1)
	Information availability of global markets is scarce. Most of the
	consumers and producers (of information as well as goods) are relegated
	to local markets in geographical vicinity. In order to reach wider
	markets, it is important for this local information to reach wider
	audiences. (Local information for global consumption LIG model).

	in bus/train timings, mobile medical van schedule changes, electricity
	outage timings, is not easily available either. (Local information
	for local consumption LIL model). We introduce the term Information
	Uptrieval to address the reverse problem of acquiring, assimilating,
	aggregating and uploading global and local information that is relevant
	for developing regions to a platform that improves the reach of the
	information. While the WWW is an obvious example of one such platform,

	strategy yields beneficial results and, moreover, determines highly

	constitutes a search algorithm that evaluates the relatedness of

  abstract = {This paper describes Brazil's photovoltaic rural school electrification
	program developed in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, from
	its demonstration phase through its current larger-scale (near 1000
	systems) deployment. Based upon several successful initial demonstration
	projects, which have shown PV could be both reliable and cost effective
	in remote rural areas, over previous 10-year period, CEMIG-Energetic
	Company of Minas Gerais (the largest utility in Brazil) has developed
	a PV rural-electrification program that is driven by quality-of-life
	improvement objectives for the electricity consumer. The Luz no Saber
	has been specifically designed inside a larger-scale rural electrification
	program (Luz para Todos - M.G.). It has been implemented in rural
	areas of Minas Gerais State by CEMIG, in collaboration with state
	and federal governments. The main objective has been to find an energy
	delivery alternative to grid connection for dispersed rural communities
	to realize the recent "Universal Attendance Law" (10438). That is,
	starting July, 2002, electric utilities in Brazil have been required
	to electrify the entire areas they serve. Because of solar resource
	availability and geographical constraints, PV is the most important
	complementary technology to satisfy the universal electrical delivery
	to rural and remote communities in Minas Gerais. The technology allows
	the access of lower-income people to lighting, communication, as
	well as a variety of educational delivery opportunities. A major
	impact has been reducing illiteracy and improving the quality of
	education. The major conclusion of this 10-year CEMIG investment
	is that an adequate service infrastructure is required to make projects
	viable, mainly characterized by a technical network which guarantees
	the system's technical performance, system design, qualified technical
	support, and also avoids a lack of unreasonable and unfulfilled user
	expectations. The lessons learned under several phases of the CEM-
	IG's PV programmes focused on the "Luz no Saber Program" are detailed
	in this paper, with the conclusion that they have helped avoid potential
	failures in this sustainability model program},

  abstract = {E-governance is a democratic practice that is gradually gaining universal
	acceptance and applicability. It refers to a governmental type aimed
	at achieving effective service delivery from government to citizens,
	moving governance from traditionalist bureaucratization to modernist
	participatory administration. This paper is situated within the global
	experience, where many countries have advanced in their practice
	of e-governance and Nigeria, as a nation cannot relish in the disadvantages
	of being left behind in a globalizing world. We strongly propose
	that there is a significant relationship between a country's technological,
	political and bureaucratic advancement and a successful e-governance
	practice. This paper argues that with the present poor state of social
	infrastructure (especially power supply and road network) in Nigeria,
	the practice of e-governance is most likely to be negatively impacted
	upon. On this note, our paper recommends a re-assessment of the country's
	state of e-governance preparedness. It recommends the application
	of proactive steps aimed at ensuring the adequate supply of electricity
	and the development of human resource capabilities of the populace
	with the aim of achieving high-level computer literacy. The interval
	convocation of stakeholders at Abuja for talk-shops is not enough.
	Rather, Internet facilities and services must of necessity be made
	easily accessible at the lowest cost, to all Nigerians, irrespective
	of how remote their locations in the country may be. The world is
	on the move and Nigeria is an integral part of it, hence, should
	not lag behind.},

	elicit design information from a population of human users. The purpose
	of this study was to address this gap in the literature by constructing
	and testing an IEC algorithm for anthropomorphic symbol design. A
	design group of 25 subjects used the algorithm to create 100 anthropomorphic
	symbols represented the emotions of anger, joy, fear, and sadness.
	The 100 symbols underwent comprehensions testing using a separate
	group of 30 subjects. Factor analysis of the nine limb angles comprising
	each symbol revealed that specific combinations of limb angles differed
	significantly between symbols based on the emotional referent the
	IEC algorithm users meant to convey. Comprehension testing results
	revealed that recognition accuracy for the joy symbols was highest
	while recognition accuracy for the anger symbols was lowest. The
	findings of the current study suggest the IEC algorithms can be used
	to identify important symbol design characteristics and generate
	symbols whose message is readily comprehended by end user populations.},

  abstract = {Purpose. Cancer patients who are deficient in literacy skills are
	particularly vulnerable to experiencing different outcomes due to
	disparities in care or barriers to care. Outcomes measurement in
	low literacy patients may provide new insight into problems previously
	undetected due to the challenges of completing paper-and-pencil forms.

	Description of study. A multimedia program was developed to provide
	a quality of life assessment platform that would be acceptable to
	patients with varying literacy skills and computer experience. One
	item at a time is presented on the computer touchscreen, accompanied
	by a recorded reading of the question. Various colors, fonts and
	graphic images are used to enhance visibility, and a small picture
	icon appears near each text element allowing patients to replay the
	sound as many times as they wish. Evaluation questions are presented
	to assess patient burden and preferences.

	Results. An ethnically diverse group of 126 cancer patients with a
	range of literacy skills and computer experience reported that the
	talking touchscreen (TT) was easy to use, and commented on the usefulness
	of the multimedia approach.

	Clinical implications. The TT is a practical, user-friendly data acquisition
	method that provides greater opportunities to measure self-reported
	outcomes in patients with a range of literacy skills. Copyright ©

  year = {2007},
  pages = {233--241},
  abstract = {Much attention has been paid to the use of ICTs to improve the delivery
	of government services to citizens in developing countries. Government
	and donor funds have adopted two strategies in parallel: (i) the
	re-engineering and automating of government services, and (ii) the
	installation of telecenters (community Internet access centers) for
	citizens to access reengineered government "e-Gov" services.


	The model of delivering e-Gov via the Internet has major drawbacks
	as shown by survey data representing 397 million people at the Bottom
	of the Pyramid (BOP) in India, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and
	Thailand. First, only 49% have even heard of the Internet and only
	2.6% have used it [15]. Second, it will take a lot more time and
	significant funds to roll-out enough telecenters to cover the BOP
	sufficiently. Third, most telecenters fail, while the successful
	ones are sustained by revenues from non-Internet services such as
	voice calls, fax and photocopying. But even these revenue streams
	may dwindle - according to our survey, over 40% of current BOP non-owners
	plan to purchase a phone within 2 years. They will spend their already-limited
	communications budgets on phones they own, not at a telecenter.


	By viewing the telephone as the end-device for e-service delivery,
	implementers can automate those parts of a government process that
	can deliver value quickly, through "smaller" (less complicated, therefore
	less likely to fail) applications. By not seeking to re-engineer
	entire government departments, these projects face less resistance
	to change from public-sector employees. Given that over 90% of those
	at the BOP use phones already [15], significant use is more likely
	if the necessary attention is paid to language, design and publicity.


	The Internet, accessed at a telecenter, and sophisticated e-Government
	systems will play a role in providing "higher-end" citizen services,
	for example submitting a passport application online with an uploaded
	digital photograph. But at a time when the Internet is barely reaching
	10.3 million people at the BOP in these countries, the paper argues
	that phones are the cheaper, more immediate and ubiquitous tool for
	Asian governments to inform, transact and interact with almost 400
	million of their most needy citizens.


	The paper presents an alternative, telephone-centric model for electronic
	delivery of public services citizens. It draws on research conducted
	by LIRNEasia in 2006 and previously published as well as unpublished
	e-Gov case studies.},

	it is pertinent to implement a number of security services such as

	WLANs, though, present a complex and challenging environment for
	implementing such security services since these services may deplete
	the limited network resources and increase the burden of supporting
	quality of service for multimedia applications. Consequently, a broker
	is needed to mediate proper security considering inputs such as user
	security requirements, user security literacy, available network
	resources, and security routines performance. In this paper we introduce
	a security broker that we have designed to fulfil these complex mediation
	needs. This broker is implemented in software and tested in a wireless
	LAN testbed. The reported security broker design and implementation
	considers the wireless LAN environment as well as the multimedia
	applications' quality of service requirements such as delay and throughput.
	We also introduce an inline encryption/decryption software that encrypts/decrypts
	traffic on the fly. Our experiments show that in cases where relatively
	modern computers are used with properly chosen standard encryptors,
	then such computers can sustain the throughput and security requirements
	of interactive multimedia applications for WLANs such as telephone-quality

  year = {1987},
  volume = {15},
  pages = {3--4},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Database systems allow quick creation of performance problems. The
	goal of database systems is to allow the computer-illiterate to write
	complex and complete applications. It is the job of the system to
	translate a high-level description of data and procedures into efficient
	algorithms. The REAL performance metric of a system is how successfully
	it meets these goals. Practitioners use a much narrower definition
	of system performance. They assume a standard workload and measure
	performance by peak throughput and by dollar cost per transaction.
	Although many vendors have “private” performance measures, Bitton,
	Dewitt, and Turbyfill were the first to publish a measure of database
	system performance [Bitton]. Their measure, here called the Wisconsin
	benchmark, consists of a database design, a set of 32 retrieval and
	update statements, and a script for multi-user tests. They give two
	performance metrics: the elapsed time for each statement and the
	throughput of the system when running sixteen simultaneous scripts.
	No response time requirement or cost measure is included in the definition.
	The Wisconsin benchmark is the most widely used database benchmark.
	Largely in response to the Wisconsin benchmark, an informal group
	including Bitton and Dewitt, defined a benchmark more representative
	of transaction processing applications [Anon]. Its workload is: SCAN
	- A mini-batch operation to sequentially copy 1000 records SORT -
	A batch operation to sort one million records. DebitCredit - A short
	transaction with terminal input and output via X.25, presentation
	services, and a mix of five database accesses. The DebitCredit transaction
	has rules for scaling the terminal network and database size as the
	transaction rate increases, and also rules for distributing transactions
	if the system is decentralized. The performance metrics for this
	benchmark are: Elapsed time for the SCAN and SORT. Peak throughput
	for the DebitCredit transaction at 1 second response time for 95%
	of the transactions. This gives a TPS (Transactions Per Second) rating.
	Price per transaction where price is the 5-year cost of hardware,
	software and maintenance. This is sometimes called the vendors-view
	of price. This benchmark has been adopted by several vendors to compare
	their performance and price performance from release to release and
	also to compare their performance to competitive products. MIPS,
	Whetstones and MegaFLOPs have served a similar role in the scientific
	community. A system's TPS rating indicates not just processor speed,
	but also IO architecture, operating system, data communications and
	database software performance. Unfortunately, it does not capture
	ease-of-use. Work continues on formalizing these benchmarks. At present
	they are written in English. Ultimately they should be defined by
	a file generator and a set of programs written in a standard database
	language such as COBOL-SQL. When a vendor first measures his system
	against these benchmarks, the results are usually terrible. Both
	benchmarks are designed to expose generic performance bugs in frequently
	used transaction processing atoms. For example, the Wisconsin and
	SCAN benchmarks heavily penalize a system which is slow to read the
	next record in a file. A system with poor performance on these benchmarks
	can be analyzed as follows: Most vendors have an “atomic” model of
	their system which represents each transaction as a collection of
	atoms. The atoms are the primitives of the system. For example, the
	SCAN benchmark is represented by most vendors as: SCAN: BEGIN TRANSACTION
	PERFORM 1000 TIMES READ SEQUENTIAL INSERT SEQUENTIAL COMMIT TRANSACTION
	The atomic weights for, BEGIN, READ SEQUENTIAL, INSERT SEQUENTIAL,
	and COMMIT are measured for each release. The atomic weight usually
	consists of CPU instructions, message bytes, and disc IOs for a “typical”
	call to that operation. These weights can be converted to service
	times by knowing the speeds and utilizations of the devices (processors,
	discs, lines) used for the application. The molecular weight and
	service time of SCAN can then be computed as the sum of the atomic
	weights. Defining and measuring a system's atoms is valuable. It
	produces a simple conceptual model of how the system is used. Atomic
	measurements also expose performance bugs. For example, based on
	the SCAN benchmark, most systems perform READ SEQUENTIAL in 1000
	instructions and with .02 disc IO. If a system uses many more instructions
	or many more IO then it has a performance problem. Similarly, the
	DebitCredit transaction typically consumes about 2OOKi (thousand
	instructions) and five disc IO per transaction. One system is known
	to use 800Ki and 14 IO per transaction. The vendor could use atomic
	measurement to find the causes of such poor performance. When such
	problems are localized to an atom, solutions to the problem readily
	suggest themselves. So, atomic measurement is useful for performance
	assurance and performance improvement. Atomic measurement also has
	a major role in system sizing and in capacity planning. If the customer
	can describe his application in terms of atoms, then a spreadsheet
	application can give him an estimate of the CPU, disc and line cost
	for the application. With substantially more effort (and assumptions)
	the system's response time can be predicted. With even more effort,
	a prototype system can be generated and benchmarked from the atomic
	transaction descriptions. Snapshot [Stewart] and Envision [Envison]
	are examples of systems which combine atomic modeling, queue modeling,
	and ultimately benchmarking of real systems generated from the atomic
	description of the application.},

	In this article, we propose three related theories to describe the

	e-commerce growth are internal to a country. Exogenous growth theory
	suggests that the primary drivers of e-commerce growth are external
	to an economic system, and reflect the forces of the regional economy.
	A blend of these, a mixed endogenous-exogenous growth theory, incorporates
	drivers from both the economy and the region of a country. We test
	a number of hypotheses about e-commerce growth in the context of
	these theories. The key variables include Internet penetration, telecommunication
	investment intensity, venture capital and credit card availability,
	and education level. The data are drawn from 17 European countries
	over a five-year period from 2000 to 2004, and are analyzed using
	panel data regression with robust error terms, a variant of weighted
	least squares. The results show the differential efficacy of internal
	and external drivers as endogenous and exogenous precursors of e-commerce
	growth across the countries for a number of different modeling specifications.
	We conclude with a discussion of alternative approaches to model
	e-commerce growth in a country. The results also suggest the appropriateness
	of exploring models of regional contagion for e-commerce growth.},

  abstract = {The digital divide has numerous aspects and is as dynamic as the technology
	industry is able to develop and disseminate new ICTs and services,
	thus increasing or creating new gaps among the more advanced societies
	and those still hampered by social and economic problems. In developing
	countries the diffusion of new technologies is often hindered by
	factors such as insufficient income, deficient infrastructure, cultural
	barriers and lack of information. Brazil is no exception to that
	rule, and all information and communication technologies (ICT) diffusion
	surveys undertaken to date confirm the trend that digital exclusion
	is following the dreadful pattern of social exclusion. The income
	disparities in Brazil are very severe and, also due to the country's
	huge territory and complex geographical and cultural formations,
	a technological innovation is seldom capable of reaching the population
	as a whole and benefiting the entire society. One outstanding exception
	is the terrestrial (free-to-air) TV, which, after about 50 years
	since its introduction, has reached an adoption rate of more than
	90%, and now covers the whole country, with enormous sociocultural
	consequences. In view of this, and with the objective of addressing
	the problem of digital exclusion, the Brazilian Government has devised
	the deployment of digital terrestrial television-DTT-as a singular
	opportunity to reduce the digital divide and to promote the access
	of the population to interactive and citizenship services through
	an already familiar interface, thus avoiding or reducing cultural
	constraints and illiteracy barriers usually posed by other ICTs.
	This study undertakes a comprehensive discussion of that policy and
	its effects, and provides some data to support the strategy: the
	results of two interrelated studies; one that maps TV users' characteristics
	and expectations regarding digital TV, and another that models the
	social network effects on the diffusion of DTT into Brazilian society
	and the users' behavior when facing the new media, namely, an agent-based
	modeling and simulation-ABMS. The model uses the mapping information
	as input to test some hypothetical scenarios in the diffusion process,
	so as to identify factors that affect the overall diffusion process.
	All these studies are in the scope of a broader and deeper methodology

  abstract = {We present a novel, interactive shape modeling technique: dynamic
	implicit solid modeling, which unifies volumetric implicit functions
	and powerful physics-based modeling. Although implicit functions
	are extremely powerful in graphics, geometric design, and shape modeling,
	the full potential of implicit functions is yet to be fully realized
	due to the lack of flexible and interactive design techniques. In
	order to broaden the accessibility of implicit functions in geometric
	modeling, we marry the implicit solids, which are semi-algebraic
	sets of volumetric implicit functions, with the principle of physics-based
	models and formulate dynamic implicit solids. By using "density springs"
	to connect the scalar values of implicit functions, we offer a viable
	solution to introduce the elasticity into implicit representations.
	As a result, our dynamic implicit solids respond to sculpting forces
	in a natural and predictive manner. The geometric and physical behaviors
	are tightly coupled in our modeling system. The flexibility of our
	modeling technique allows users to easily modify the geometry and
	topology of sculpted objects, while the inherent physical properties
	can provide a natural interface for direct, force-based free-form
	deformation. The additional constraints provide users more control
	on the dynamic implicit solids. We have developed a sculpting system
	equipped with a large variety of physics-based toolkits and an intuitive
	haptic interface to facilitate the direct, natural editing of implicit
	functions in real-time. Our experiments demonstrate many attractive

  abstract = {Objective: As low literacy affects the assessment of health-related
	quality of life (HRQoL) in several ways (e.g., subject eligibility
	and cost of administration), better approaches to HRQoL assessment
	in subjects with varying literacy levels are needed.


	Methods: We developed a multimedia touchscreen program (the Smiling
	Touchscreen, ST) to administer HRQoL instruments to subjects with
	varying levels of Chinese language and computer literacy, using an
	iterative process where patients' input on design, clarity of instructions,
	and user-friendliness were repeatedly gathered and incorporated in
	development. The ST thus has several user-friendly features for low-literacy
	subjects (e.g., presentation of individual items using visual and
	auditory stimuli, voice-text synchronization, and visual analog scale
	with a touch and drag function), which we evaluated using qualitative
	and quantitative methods.


	Results: The ST was well accepted by subjects (n = 66, 76% female,
	median [interquartile] age: 49.0 [40.0, 56.0]) with high (n = 43)
	or low (n = 23) literacy, 98% of whom found it easy or very easy
	to use, and 85% found the voice-text synchronization feature useful.
	In low-literacy subjects without computer experience (30%), none
	reported any difficulties using the ST. The median (interquartile)
	time spent to complete the ST (four Instruction and Practice screens,
	24 questions, one visual analog scale) for high- and low-literacy
	groups was 13.9 (9.6, 23.9) and 23.2 (15.8, 26.5) minutes, respectively.
	Among subjects expressing a preference (n = 47), 21 (47%) favored
	the ST over interviewer- or self-administration.


	Conclusion: The ST is well accepted by subjects with varying literacy
	levels, including those without computer experience. It is thus a
	promising new approach for HRQoL assessment among subjects with varying
	literacy levels.},

  abstract = {Networked appliances are consumer or household devices with a network
	interface which allows them to he connected to a (home) network.
	Networked appliances offer major benefits compared to their conventional
	equivalent. Software services can operate upon an array of these
	appliances to offer value added functionality. In this case the user
	interface to control the appliances will be inadequate. Commonly
	networked appliances may either he controlled using the traditional
	user interface, such as switches and buttons on the device, or alternatively
	using a PC based interface. Traditional user interfaces often cannot
	support the full functionality offered by the appliance. The PC based
	interfaces tend to be too complicated for the average user and enables
	the PC based interface to be suitable and available in many situations.
	Therefore a user interface which supports the new functionalities
	and is easy to use is required. In this paper, Anoto functionality
	enabled pen and paper are suggested as a suitable interface. Pen
	and paper are well known to all users and suitable paper forms make
	it straightforward to fully control and program networked appliances
	without a PC interface. Thus an important barrier to the acceptance
	of networked appliances is broken. Furthermore, the presented approach
	can be used to integrate the control of multiple appliances and services.
	A major challenge to this work has been the integration of different
	network protocols used in the home. The use of an OSGi gateway has
	proven a great help to integrate them. This paper discusses an approach
	to the integration of pen and paper with networked appliances using
	an OSGi gateway. Because of the use of an OSGi gateway, the approach
	is not restricted to controlling devices which use a specific single
	network protocol. Rather, the approach can be used with appliances
	which communicate using a wide variety of protocols.},

	Sample Fifty-one female patients, who are low literate and naïve computer
	users, newly diagnosed with early stage breast cancer from two urban
	public hospitals.


	Intervention A computerized decision aid that combines entertainment-education
	(edutainment) with enhanced (factual) content. An interactive jewellery
	box is featured to assist women in: (1) recording and reflecting
	over issues of concern with possible treatments, (2) deliberating
	over surgery decision, and (3) communicating with physician and significant
	others.


	Outcomes Patients' use of the jewellery box to store issues during
	completion of the CPtDA, and perceived clarity of values in making
	a treatment decision, as measured by a low literacy version of the
	Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS).


	Results Over half of the participants utilized the jewellery box to
	store issues they found concerning about the treatments. On average,
	users flagged over 13 issues of concern with the treatments. Scores
	on the DCS Uncertainty and Feeling Unclear about Values subscales
	were lower after the intervention compared to before the decision
	was made.


	Conclusions A values clarification exercise using an interactive jewellery
	box may be a promising method for promoting informed treatment decision
	making by low literacy breast cancer patients.},

  abstract = {We describe work toward the goal of a user interface (UI) designed
	such that even novice, illiterate users require absolutely no intervention
	from anyone at all to use. Our text-free UI is based on many hours
	of ethnographic design conducted in collaboration with a community
	of illiterate domestic laborers in three Bangalore slums. An ethnographic
	design process was used to understand what kind of application subjects
	would be interested in, how they respond to computing technology,
	and how they react to specific UI elements. We built two applications
	using these principles, one for job search for domestic laborers
	and another for a generic map that could be used for navigating a
	city. The resulting designs are based on key lessons that we gained
	through the design process. This article describes the design process,
	the design principles, which evolved out of the process, the final
	application designs, and results from initial user testing. Our results
	confirm previous work that emphasizes the need for semiabstracted
	graphics and voice feedback, but we additionally find that some aspects
	of design for illiterate users that have been previously overlooked
	(such as a consistent help feature). Results also show that the text-free
	designs are strongly preferred over standard text-based interfaces
	by the communities which we address and that they are potentially
	able to bring even complex computer functions within the reach of
	users who are unable to read.},

  abstract = {Picture languages are on attractive basis for communication. However,
	it is difficult to represent and understand accurate meaning in such

	captions are allocated on positions of a 2D structure and special
	translators generate corresponding sentences in natural languages.
	These positions have pre-defined meaning and represent a multimedia
	hieroglyph. The hieroglyph is a complex picture (a multimedia sentence)
	including more simple pictures (multimedia words). In this approach
	the "hieroglyphic writing" is reduced to selecting appropriate multimedia
	words through special interface panels without necessity to use keyboards.
	As a result, the users can send and receive multimedia messages,
	though they have never used a computer before. In this paper, methods
	and implementation techniques for translating multimedia hieroglyphs

	provides a valuable means for automating time consuming checks not

	checkers have been closely coupled with compilation systems, and
	therefore tend to be applicable to the code itself and not to all
	of the textual information (such as makefiles, comments, documentation
	sources) surrounding the code. The generic nature of Exstatic allows
	it to overcome these boundaries, and indeed it can be applied to
	any medium for which there is a formally definable syntax and (to
	an extent) semantics. Exstatic can therefore be used to increase
	the productivity and quality of documentation of programs, checking
	for such things as adherence to house style, consistency with the
	program being documented and self consistency. This paper describes
	the design and use of Exstatic, with particular reference to its

	to ensure compliance. The delivery mechanism for information must
	be accessible to all users, including users with vision, hearing,
	motor, or cognitive disabilities.Users consume information from many
	different sources. An increasingly popular method of distributing
	information is using computers and the Internet. The Web houses volumes
	of documents and graphics available to anyone at any time. Paired
	with assistive technology such as Home Page Reader, the Internet
	makes information that would otherwise be restrictive accessible.However,
	as approachable as the Internet may be with its sheer volume of information,
	it does have limitations. The old saying about a chain, that it is
	only as good as its weakest link, aptly describes the Internet. Beside
	problems with retrievability and searchability, many other issues
	plague this vehicle of information. No matter how sophisticated HTML,
	DHTML, XHTML, and XML present information, the graphics within the
	body text are the weakest link, from the viewpoint of users with
	visual or cognitive impairments.This presentation is divided into
	two sections and explores how a method of creating and exporting
	graphics can improve the experiences of users with visual or cognitive
	impairments when viewing technical documentation:


	 * Clear, concise, and well-structured diagrams enable better comprehension
	for the cognitively impaired suffering from dyslexia and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactive

	support real-time speech-based user interfaces as part of an effort

	model. The computationally intensive task of speech model training

	actual recognition of speech is conducted on low-cost hand-held devices
	using custom hardware. The recognizer is extremely flexible and can
	support multiple languages or dialects with speaker-independent recognition.
	Dynamic loading of speech models is used for changing language grammar
	and retraining, while reprogramming is used to support evolution
	of recognition algorithms. The focus on small sets of words (at one
	time) reduces the complexity, cost and power consumption. We design
	the speech decoder, the central component of the recognizer, and
	we validate it via a prototype FPGA implementation. We then use ASIC
	synthesis to estimate power and size for the design. Our evaluations
	demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in power compared with
	optimized recognition software running on a low-power embedded general-purpose
	processor of the same technology and of similar capabilities. The
	synthesis also estimates the area of the design to be about 2.5mm,
	showing potential for lower cost. In designing and testing our recognizer

	entail an increase in citizen participation. The VOTESCRIPT group
	has made a sociological analysis to determine the causes of this
	apparent failure, reaching the conclusion that users are demanding
	capabilities that are not available in present systems.


	This paper presents a proposal for an advanced system of debate in
	an environment of digital democracy which overcomes the limitations
	of existing systems. We have been especially careful in applying
	security procedures in telematic systems, for they are to offer citizens
	the guarantees that society demands. New functional tools have been
	included to ensure user authentication and to permit anonymous participation
	where the system is unable to disclose or even to know the identity
	of system users. The platform prevents participation by non-entitled
	persons who do not belong to the authorized group from giving their
	opinion. Furthermore, this proposal allows for verifying the proper
	function of the system, free of tampering or fraud intended to alter
	the conclusions or outcomes of participation. All these tools guarantee
	important aspects of both a social and technical nature, most importantly:
	freedom of expression, equality and auditability.},

  journal = {ICEGOV '07: Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory
	and practice of electronic governance},
  year = {2007},
  pages = {357--365},
  abstract = {The dynamics of public administration in India have altered drastically
	with the introduction of e-governance as a guiding concept in the
	late 1980s. Citizens, the world over, have been demanding smaller,
	effective and responsive governments, obviously inspired by the unprecedented
	and rapid success of finance capital in the global market. Consequently,
	policy makers began the search for smaller and efficient governments.
	On an evolutionary plane, reengineering of service systems, performance
	management, transparency in government operations, down sizing or
	right sizing the government workforce, emphasis on delivery of reliable
	public services and ultimately citizen satisfaction came to be considered
	as benchmarks by most of the administrators. Quick decision-making,
	data-based planning, effective implementation through quantitative
	techniques seemed to have clinched the issue. This reformative pattern
	was no different in the Indian context, where the governments at
	the federal and state levels were in search of new techniques and
	technologies.


	Information technology has been found to be very useful in reinvigorating
	the government administrative systems by enhancing their capacity
	and efficiency. The potential and scope for application of IT in
	governing processes and transactions are enormous. E-government can
	transform traditional administrative systems through employment of
	information and communication technologies. A governance system that
	is committed to working with civil society, and by extension, private
	industry in a transparent and accountable way to reduce poverty,
	redress imbalances in access to resources, foster security and uphold
	social, economic, cultural, civil and political rights is the ultimate
	objective of e-governance theory. In practice, much depends on the
	collaboration patterns that the governments seek to establish.


	E-governance practices in India emerged and evolved mainly from native
	intuition, but under prescription for lesser and transparent government
	by international financial institutions, mainly the World Bank and
	the International Monetary Fund. However, the range of success of
	e-governance initiatives has not been uniform. The bottom-up demand
	for delivery of electronic services was bleak initially, but the
	change in public perception was for the better with the governments
	roping in private industry and service-oriented organizations gradually.


	The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model as is construed normally
	in a world that is fast witnessing globalization of all businesses
	and administrative trends, especially in the realm of e-governance,
	involves features such lesser government investment in electronic
	delivery of public services, collaboration in conceptualizing, designing
	and implementing the e-governance projects besides increased participation
	of stakeholders -- both private and public -- to saturate the levels
	and the reach of such projects. India is no exception to the general
	rule dictating PPP mode in e-governance.


	The unprecedented success of the PPP modules in e-governance in India
	can be rightly established with two path-breaking e-governance models
	- e-Seva in the state of Andhra Pradesh and Bhoomi in Karnataka.
	These projects not only caused a jump in revenue collections of the
	two state governments, but also timely payment by the citizens. Time
	and costs for availing public services have come down drastically
	bringing in a positive change in peoples' perception of e-governance
	theory and practice. This holds equally true for both the rural and
	urban populace. The result of all these radical changes in public
	administration systems is the enhanced satisfaction level of the
	citizenry on delivery of public services and simplification of governmental
	procedures. The above mentioned e-government projects can serve as
	models for all the developing societies.},

	We refer to these users as secondary users to distinguish them from

	via a proxy primary user who has the required access rights and skills.
	The proxy's filtering and funneling decisions limit the secondary
	users' information-seeking behavior; the secondary user might also
	have an unequal power relationship with the proxy. Therefore, secondary
	users might never know the full scope of actions and knowledge available
	to them. If we are to realize the egalitarian potential of computing,
	we must consider secondary users in the design process. We must develop

	certain aspects of phonological processing may not be acquired spontaneously,
	but are modulated by learning an alphabetic written language, that
	is, learning to read and write. It appears that learning an alphabetic
	written language modifies the auditory-verbal (spoken) language processing
	competence in a nontrivial way. We have previously suggested, based
	on behavioral and functional neuroimaging data, that auditory-verbal
	and written language interact not only during certain language tasks,
	but that learning and developing alphabetic written language capacities
	significantly modulates the spoken language system. Specifically,
	the acquisition of alphabetic orthographic knowledge has a modulatory
	influence on sublexical phonological processing and the awareness
	of sublexical phonological structure. We have suggested that developing
	an orthographic representation system for an alphabetic written language,
	and integrating a phoneme-grapheme correspondence with an existing
	infrastructure for auditory-verbal language processing, will result
	in a modified language network. Specifically, we suggest that the
	parallel interactive processing characteristics of the underlying
	language-processing brain network differ in literate and illiterate
	subjects. Therefore, the pattern of interactions between the regions
	of a suitably defined large-scale functional-anatomical network for
	language processing will differ between literate and illiterate subjects
	during certain language tasks. In order to investigate this hypothesis
	further, we analyzed the observed covariance structure in a PET data
	set from a simple auditory-verbal repetition paradigm in literate
	and illiterate subjects, with a network approach based on structural
	equation modeling (SEM). Based on a simple network model for language
	processing, the results of the present network analysis indicate
	that the network interactions during word and pseudoword repetition
	in the illiterate group differ, while there were no significant differences
	in the literate group. The differences between the two tasks in the
	illiterate group may reflect differences in attentional modulation
	of the language network, executive aspects of verbal working memory
	and the articulatory organization of verbal output. There were no
	significant differences between the literate and illiterate group
	during word repetition. In contrast, the network interactions differed
	between the literate and illiterate group during pseudoword repetition.
	In addition to differences similar to those observed in the illiterate
	group between word and pseudoword repetition, there were differences
	related to the interactions of the phonological loop between the
	groups. In particular, these differences related to the interaction
	between Broca's area and the inferior parietal cortex as well as
	the posterior-midinsula bridge between Wernicke's and Broca's area.
	In conclusion, the results of this network analysis are consistent
	with our previously presented results and support the hypothesis
	that learning to read and write during childhood influences the functional
	architecture of the adult human brain. In particular, the basic auditory-verbal
	language network in the human brain is modified as a consequence
	of acquiring orthographic language skills.},

	software could be used to support the delivery of a standardized
	reading curriculum to adults with low-level literacy skills. Three
	primary questions were addressed in the study. First, how readily
	could mass-market continuous voice recognition software programs
	be adapted for use in adult literacy training? Second, what role(s)
	might the voice recognition technology play in facilitating the computer-based
	delivery of a standard text-based reading curriculum? And third,
	does the use of the voice recognition software positively affect
	the technological skills and computing comfort levels of adults with
	low-level literacy skills?


	Five adults with low-level literacy skills completed the computer-based
	curriculum, using the voice recognition software to practice and
	check their reading and writing efforts. A literacy tutor guided
	the participants through the curriculum, recorded and saved the participants'
	responses and videotaped the sessions for subsequent analysis.


	The findings reported here suggest that currently available over-the-counter
	continuous voice recognition technology, while essentially effective
	and accurate with fluent readers, is not yet ready, as a stand-alone
	system, to meet the needs of these adults with low-level literacy
	skills. The voice recognition software was most effective when it
	was used in the presence of a tutor. Having tutors provide on-going
	and immediate support to learners was a vital component of literacy
	training in this computer-based environment. In general the computer-based
	programs seemed to provide participants with a `motivational boost'.
	Specifically, the computer-based lessons helped develop participants'
	technological skills and confidence levels and promoted sustained
	focus on instructional tasks. Implications associated with these
	findings for future research with voice recognition software and
	adult literacy training are discussed.},

	without the help of a literate mediator. Speech recognition has often
	been suggested as a key to universal access, but success stories

	the linguistic resources needed to power a simple spoken dialog system.
	In our approach, data collection is integrated into dialog design:
	Users of a given village are recorded during interactions, and their
	speech semi-automatically integrated into the acoustic models for
	that village, thus generating the linguistic resources needed for
	automatic recognition of their speech. Our design is multi-modal,
	scalable, and modifiable. It is the result of an international, cross-disciplinary
	collaboration between researchers and NGO workers who serve the rural
	poor in Tamil Nadu. Our groundwork includes user studies, stakeholder
	interviews and field recordings of literate and illiterate agricultural
	workers in three districts of Tamil Nadu over the summer and fall
	of 2005. Automatic speech recognition experiments simulating the
	spoken dialog systems' performance during initialization and gradual
	integration of acoustic data informed the holistic structure of the

  abstract = {In this paper, we explain a personalized agricultural advisory system
	called eSagu, which has been developed to improve the performance
	and utilization of agriculture technology and help Indian farmers.
	In eSagu, rather than visiting the crop in person, the agricultural
	expert delivers the expert advice at regular intervals (once in one
	or two weeks) to each farm by getting the crop status in the form
	of digital photographs and other information. During 2004-06, through
	eSagu, agricultural expert advices delivered for about 6000 farms
	covering six crops. The results show that the expert advices helped
	the farmers to achieve savings in capital investment and improved
	the crop yield. Mainly, the data warehouse of farm histories has
	been developed which is providing the crop related information to
	the agricultural expert in an integrated manner for generating a
	quality agricultural expert advice. In this paper, after explaining
	eSagu and its advantages, we discuss how data warehouse of farm histories
	is enabling agricultural expert to deliver a quality expert advice.
	We also discuss some research issues to improve the performance of
	eSagu.},

  abstract = {Objective


	A comprehensive questionnaire was designed to assess the knowledge
	and understanding of injecting drug users (IDUs) regarding their
	HIV disease, and to determine any factors that may increase the acceptance
	of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by this group.


	Results


	Twenty percent of the total IDU cohort attending the GUIDE (GenitoUrinary
	Medicine and Infectious Diseases) clinic participated in the study.
	Fifty-two percent had been homeless in the past 5 years and 84% are
	unemployed. Seventy-two percent of patients did not complete second
	level education and 10% were illiterate. Fifty-one percent had siblings
	or parents with a history of injection drug misuse, and 25% had at
	least one sibling also HIV positive. Forty-seven percent started
	using drugs before the age of 13 years, and the most common initial
	drug was heroin (44%). Ninety-five percent had attended for methadone
	maintenance therapy (MMT), with 39% currently attending for daily
	therapy. The majority of patients were unable to simply explain or
	interpret CD4 cell counts (54%) and 'viral loads' (65%). Fifty-seven
	percent of patients were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy
	(HAART). There was a statistically significant association between
	patients receiving HAART and both attendance at a primary care physician
	for methadone maintenance therapy (P = 0.005), and weekly take-outs
	of methadone (P = 0.005). There was also an association between adherence
	to HAART and attendance at a methadone maintenance clinic (P = 0.04).


	Conclusions


	This study highlights the chaotic lifestyle and complex social background
	of the IDU. Such factors were not, however, associated with acceptance
	of HAART. The primary factor associated with both the acceptance
	of and adherence to HAART was regular and stable attendance for methadone
	therapy.},

	been high. The capital expense is dominated by antenna tower (40m:

	significantly to the cost too (about U.S. $3,100). The revenue generated

	implements a multi-literate design in which the system can be customized
	based on the abilities and preferences of the user. An evaluation
	of CKS, conducted in a rural agricultural community in the Dominican

	lacking involvement in health decisions.


	Objective To explore the information needs and understanding of adults
	with varying literacy in relation to colorectal cancer screening,
	and to consider their responses to two versions of a decision aid.


	Participants Thirty-three men and women aged 45–74 years were recruited
	from Adult Basic Education classes (n = 17) and University Continuing
	Education programs (n = 16).


	Methods We used qualitative methods (in-depth, semi-structured interviews)
	to compare and contrast the views of adults with lower and higher
	literacy levels, to gain a better understanding of how people with
	lower literacy value and interpret specific DA content and components;
	and determine whether needs and preferences are specific to lower
	literacy groups or generic across the broad literacy spectrum.


	Results Regardless of literacy perspective, participants' interpretations
	of the DA were shaped by their prior knowledge and expectations,
	as well as their values and preferences. This influenced perceptions
	of the DAs role in supporting informed decision making. A linguistic
	theoretical model was applied to interpret the findings. This facilitated
	considerations beyond the traditional focus on the readability of
	materials.


	Conclusion Decision aids developers may find it useful to apply alternative
	approaches (linguistic) when creating DAs for consumers of varying
	literacy.},

	Taking into consideration the high illiteracy rate within the Moroccan

	citizens especially those who are illiterate.


	The objective of this research is exploring the different architectures,

	people in order for them to interact with the static content and
	to use the online transactions. In the process of achieving our goal,
	we had to discover and create design principles and to test them

  abstract = {With the information revolution that promises to shape the 21st century,
	knowledge has become the prime commodity, very much like land, means
	of production and capital have been at different times in the past.
	Access to information, made instantly available by the growth of
	the Internet, determines access to economic resources, social participation
	and better quality of life. For this reason, the knowledge stored
	on the Web and the advantages offered by the spread of Information
	and Communication Technology (ICT) are equally important for rich
	societies to prosper and for poor ones to develop. The only difference
	is that marginalised communities do not have access to the tools
	and have little control over the content found in the domain of ICTs.
	In this paper we describe an intervention to develop the potential
	of a typical rural community in South Africa through ICTs. This involves
	providing Internet connectivity and deploying a platform to support
	e-commerce, e-learning, e-government and e-health. The core of the
	platform is an ontology-based model designed to integrate and respond
	to Indigenous Knowledge Systems. This has been achieved by combining
	a deep understanding of local knowledge and social networks with
	the use of authoring, communication and ontology-management tools.
	The primary goal of this new approach is to find a way to make ICT
	solutions more sensitive to the local context, and therefore more
	effective. Secondly, we hope to foster a sense of ownership of the
	project among the community, by capitalising on local knowledge and
	resources.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the additional uses of CALL in the Endangered
	Language (EL) context. It briefly reviews ELs and reports on CALL
	for ELs in general. It then reviews the extra uses of CALL for ELs;
	these include changing negative attitudes towards the language, arousing
	interest in the language and contributing to language maintenance
	and documentation. In order to demonstrate the benefits of CALL for
	an EL, three examples are presented. Each of the ELs discussed in
	this paper could be considered to be on a different scale on the
	Fishman (1991) Scale for an EL. The first CALL application discussed
	is a program for Irish for primary school children. Irish is a Celtic
	language and is only regularly used by about 10,000 speakers in Ireland.
	The main aim of the program was to try to increase the children’s
	motivation to study Irish, which is a compulsory subject in schools
	in Ireland. The second application is a literacy program for Tojolab’al,
	a Mayan language spoken in Chiapas, Mexico. Tojolab’al could be considered
	to be a relatively stable language (30,000–40,000 speakers out of
	an ethnic population of about 80,000 people), but it has very few
	literate speakers. The idea of this project was to develop CALL courseware
	to teach literacy, beginning with the letters and then progressing
	to words and phrases. The third example is CALL courseware for Nawat,
	an Uto-Aztecan language of El Salvador. The remaining 150 speakers
	of Nawat are mainly elderly and illiterate and this courseware aimed
	to document and develop courseware for the language, while the remaining
	speakers were still alive. The paper concludes with lessons learnt
	for ELs in general from these three specific examples. It surmises
	that despite the difficulties involved in the CALL for EL context,
	if a pragmatic approach is adopted, CALL materials can have positive
	social benefits, which probably outweigh its contribution to language
	learning in the short-term. The effort involved in CALL for ELs is
	definitely worthwhile.},

  journal = {The Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Computer Personnel on Research
	Conference},
  year = {1983},
  pages = {75--78},
  abstract = {There was a time when computer knowledge was so esoteric that only
	specialists needed to be educated. Only large organizations had computers
	and skills were needed only by the professional staff. Now the scene
	has changed. Computers are being used in the smallest of firms. Today
	there are millions of computers in homes, and there are offices with
	more computers and/or terminals than employees. There is some possibility
	that in the future all financial transactions and much shopping will
	be done by computer. Thus it is obvious that computer literacy is
	needed by all people. The question is not whether but rather what
	kind of education is required. There are three levels of understanding
	that may be imparted in education. One can teach a subject to the
	level of a basic understanding or general knowledge. Or one can provide
	detailed knowledge. Finally, one can develop in the student the ability
	to make skillful use of the subject area. Music appreciation, counterpoint
	and private vocal lessons illustrate the differences in one field
	of study. In curriculum development in business we tend to solve
	the question of depth of knowledge this way. All students are required
	to have a general understanding of the business core and a detailed
	knowledge of a major field. In addition, we expect that skills be
	developed in communications and quantitative methods. We carried
	over this pattern into data processing. However, we didn't know whether
	DP was a quantitative area requiring skill development or not. Thus
	we have Introduction to Data Processing courses that develop a programming
	skill in some language and others that just talk about programming
	but don't do any of it. There is substantial disagreement among educators
	as to the correct course of action. This lack of agreement, as well
	as a belated entry into DP education, has resulted in a limited and
	uneven computer education in colleges of business. Our graduates
	vary from computer illiterate to very skillful user. What to do about
	this situation is the focus of this study.},

	objects and visual tools based on its role in the visual production
	process. To guide the visual design process, we have formulated a
	set of design principles that ensure the expressiveness and effectiveness
