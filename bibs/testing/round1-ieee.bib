 abstract = {Abstract This study aims to design a framework for a knowledge management system in a cloud computing environment using a knowledge engineering approach. The research comprised 2 steps: 1) analyzing and synthesizing the relevant literature with regard to knowledge management systems in a cloud computing environment using a knowledge engineering approach and 2) designing a framework for a knowledge management system in a cloud computing environment using a knowledge engineering approach. Data were analyzed using content analysis. A knowledge management system consists of four components as follows: 1) knowledge retrieval 2) knowledge storage 3) knowledge sharing and 4) knowledge publishing. The knowledge engineering approach consists of three components as follows: 1) knowledge acquisition 2) knowledge storage and 3) knowledge utilization.},
