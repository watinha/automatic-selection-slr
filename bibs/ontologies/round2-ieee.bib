The web has evolved and is being extended continuously. Its services are becoming more and more complex. Nevertheless, one of the principal benefits and challenges in services of the web is for those services to be offered in a useful, flexible, effective and reliable way. The quality of web services is as much challenging as it is important to meet. Testing of Web services is important due to their wider application areas. Due to their benefits in every field, business builders is trying to adopt this new style to provide their service so need greater attention to meet the best quality practices. This study is based on an investigation of testing approaches for web services, assessment of their working based on defined criteria and research questions which are eventually helpful in addressing what type of parameters are useful to provide the best quality web services. This provides new research areas for the researcher to achieve expertise in these identified areas too. This survey is based on such techniques which have a practical implementation in real life scenarios. The main purpose of this work is to analyze what parameters are essential to provide quality assurance and how the quality can be further improved. Moreover, this study also provides help for the software quality assurance team to understand the existing approaches, their advantages and limitations and hence helps in applying and considering suitable plans to achieve quality assurance of web services depending on different scenarios.},

Cloud Computing is a popular solution that has been used in recent years to cooperate and collaborate among distributed applications over networks. Effective testing to ensure cloud service quality becomes a key for the cloud computing adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework that generates test cases for cloud services based on SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture). This approach uses source code comments to create WSDL-Ss (Web Service Semantics) and upload these WSDL-Ss to third parties, e.g. UDDI (Universal Description Discovery and Integration). In the third parties, the WSDL-Ss are translated to ESGs (Event Sequence Graphs) to model the cloud services. Finally, test cases are created from the ESGs to verify the cloud services' accuracy. A prototype system with a cloud banking is provided to illustrate this framework.},

With the rapid development of Web services, Web service discovery becomes a significant challenge in the matching precision and efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel method in the view of users' requirements for Web Service discovery. We set up the requirement model firstly, so as to present users' requirements in details, then cluster the Web Services due to users' common requirements, and obtain corresponding Web services' QoS values. Thus, users can find their really needed Web services in an ordered list. The case study indicates the effect of our method, namely, in the view of users' requirements, we sort the candidate Services due to their functions and their QoS attributes in descending order.},

Over the last fifteen years, Web applications have evolved from the early simple and hyper-text based ones into the more complex, interactive, usable and adaptive applications of the new generations. New paradigms, architectures, and technologies for developing Web-based systems continuously emerge and transform this specific context. At the same time, new techniques and tools for effectively testing them have been proposed. This paper reports some relevant contributions about the Web application testing topic that appeared in the past editions of the Web Systems Evolution international symposium (WSE) and discusses some future trends for this specific field.},

To solve the problem of modeling and formally verifying the composition of cloud manufacturing services, a new modeling and formal verification approach based on Calculus for Orchestration of Web Service (COWS) combined with Unified Modeling Language (UML) was proposed. First UML activity diagram for Cloud Manufacturing service composition was built with MagicDraw software, and saved as an XML file. The XML file was translated into a COWS file via UML4SOA, and formally verified with COWS Model Checking program (CMC). Furthermore, a composite service about part processing was given. Activity diagram of the service composition was built, including milling service, drilling service, exception handling, event handling and compensation mechanism. Finally, the composition verification result showed that the proposed approach was feasible.},
